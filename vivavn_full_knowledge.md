## Best time to visit An Bang Beach
To help you plan the best time to visit An Bang Beach, let’s first take a look at the weather in Hoi An throughout the year. Understanding the seasonal changes can make your beach experience even more enjoyable!
The first three months are cool, with gentle sunshine and occasional showers.
From April to July, it’s the hottest time of the year, with temperatures reaching up to 36-37°C on some days.
August and September bring a transition period, with light sunshine, afternoon rain showers, and pleasant, cooler evenings.
The last three months of the year are the rainy season, Hoi An can experience occasional flooding.
In our opinion, the ideal time to visit An Bang Beach is during the months of April, May, June, July, and August. During this period, you’ll enjoy warm weather and plenty of sunshine, making it perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and enjoying all the beach activities.
## How to get to An Bang Beach
### Directions
If you’re coming from the Ancient Town of Hoi An, An Bang Beach is just a short 5 km away to the northeast. As you make your way out of the bustling streets of Hoi An, you’ll pass through scenic rice fields and the famous [Tra Que Vegetable Village](https://vivavn.com/tra-que-vegetable-village/).
From Da Nang city, An Bang Beach is located about 25 km south. Simply follow the coastal road, and you’ll find yourself at this beautiful beach in no time.
### Transport
From Hoi An, you can easily reach An Bang Beach by bike, motorbike, taxi, Grab, or even on foot. We highly recommend biking for the best experience! This way, you can soak in the charming countryside scenery of Hoi An and take a quick stop at the 400-year-old Tra Que Vegetable Village to see how local farmers grow their organic produce.
If you’re starting from Da Nang, you also have the option to bike, ride a motorbike, or take a taxi or Grab to An Bang Beach. Given the 25 km distance, we suggest renting a motorbike for a convenient ride—there are plenty of rental shops available in Da Nang.

# Mo Cau Xu Tien: The Startup Turning Areca Leaf Sheaths into Eco-Friendly Plates
We’d like to introduce you to a startup that makes eco-friendly products from areca leaf sheaths

___Once thought of as discarded waste,[ areca leaf sheaths ](https://vivavn.com/areca-leaf-sheaths/)have now become the material of choice for a startup in Tien Phuoc, Quang Nam. They transform them into eco-friendly plates, contributing to the fight against single-use plastic waste.___
## Introduction
[The UN Environment programme reports](https://www.unep.org/interactives/beat-plastic-pollution/) that our annual plastic waste production has skyrocketed to a staggering 400 million tons. This surge is largely fueled by the rampant use of single-use plastics, including plastic products for food and beverage containers and packaging, which accounts for 36% of all plastic produced. Even more concerning is the fact that approximately 85% of these disposable items find their way into landfills or become unregulated waste, painting a grim picture for our environment.
In the fight against plastic waste, a Vietnamese startup called Mo Cau Xu Tien, based in Tien Phuoc District, Quang Nam Province, is creating plates and utensils that are good for the environment. They make them from areca leaf sheaths.
## Areca leaf sheaths: nature’s gift
The areca palm tree is a familiar sight across Vietnam. Many households in rural villages plant several of these trees in front of their homes to harvest the areca nuts. Traditionally, Vietnamese people use these nuts for the betel chewing custom. Major areas known for growing areca palms in Vietnam include Thuy Nguyen district in Hai Phong city, Son Tay district in Quang Ngai province, and Tien Phuoc district in Quang Nam province.
The areca leaf sheath is the petiole of the areca palm leaf that wraps around the trunk of the areca palm. They are thin and flat, with a fibrous tissue structure. The size of the leaf sheath varies depending on the size of the palm tree, typically ranging from 20 to 30 cm in width and 50 to 60 cm in length, with a thickness of about 1 to 2 mm. When the areca palm leaf withers and falls off, the areca leaf sheath also falls off. At this point, it is usually dry and very tough.
Plates and utensils made from areca leaf sheaths are highly environmentally friendly. After use, they decompose completely in the natural environment within just several months. Areca leaf sheaths are usually harvested from naturally fallen areca palm leaves, without the need to cut down the entire tree. This sustainable practice contributes to the preservation of the areca palm trees.
## Introducing Mo Cau Xu Tien: pioneers of sustainable dining
Phan Vu Hoai Vui – the founder of Mo Cau Xu Tien
Mo Cau Xu Tien is a startup based in Tien Phuoc District, Quang Nam Province, Vietnam. Founded in 2020, the company aims to utilize the abundant local areca leaf sheaths to create[ eco-friendly products](https://vivavn.com/vietnam-eco-friendly-products/) as an alternative to single-use plastic.
Phan Vu Hoai Vui, the founder of Mo Cau Xu Tien, was born and raised in the rural village of Loc Yen, Tien Phuoc. After graduating from university, she moved to Ho Chi Minh City to pursue her career as an accountant. Although she no longer lived in her hometown, she always cherished the beautiful memories of the village with its lush green areca palm trees. She fondly remembers her childhood playing in the areca palm gardens with her siblings and friends.
Always concerned about the environment, Phan Vu Hoai Vui observed the growing popularity of single-use plastic in Vietnam and its negative impact.
In 2020, amidst the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, she had to pause her work in Ho Chi Minh City and return to her hometown. One day, while walking in the garden and noticing the fallen areca leaf sheaths scattered everywhere, she pondered – what if those fallen areca leaf sheaths could be transformed into a sustainable alternative?
Sharing this idea with her family, she received strong support from everyone. She used her entire life savings to launch Mo Cau Xu Tien.
## Crafting Eco-Friendly Plates: The Process Unveiled
In Tien Phuoc, there’s an abundance of areca leaf sheaths, often seen as waste, which locals typically collect and discard when they fall into gardens. However, now these areca leaf sheaths are being purchased by Mo Cau Xu Tien. This usually happens between March and August each year, the period when areca leaf sheaths fall the most.
Once collected, the sheaths are transported to the factory where workers carefully select the best ones. They discard any that are moldy or damaged. The selected sheaths are then washed, dried, and shaped into various products using specialized machines. Currently, Mo Cau Xu Tien produces 16 different types of products, including serving trays, plates, bowls, spoons, and even hand fans.
After the products are shaped, they are sterilized using ultraviolet light to eliminate harmful bacteria and microorganisms. This ensures that the products are safe for use and free of any harmful contaminants.
These products feature distinctive patterns that highlight the natural beauty of the material. Their colors are purely derived from the raw material itself. Additionally, the products emit a delightful natural fragrance without the need for any artificial additives or chemicals.
## More than just plates: the impact of Mo Cau Xu Tien
Local residents collect areca sheaths from their gardens, dry them, and sell them to Mo Cau Xu Tien.
Mo Cau Xu Tien partners with local residents by actively buying areca leaf sheaths they previously discarded. This innovative initiative gives new value to what was once considered waste, transforming it into a valuable economic resource for the community. Residents can now earn extra income.
The startup is currently providing employment for 5 women in the local area, helping them earn between $160 and $200 per month. By purchasing mo cau from local people, the company has also created an additional source of income for those who previously considered it a waste product.

Subject: Inquiry about Areca Product Manufacturing Training and Collaboration
Dear Mo Cau Xu Tien,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Thandar Phru, and I am writing on behalf of Nonprofit Community Based Organization based in Myanmar. We are currently working on eco-friendly initiatives aimed at reducing plastic use and promoting sustainable, biodegradable materials.
We are particularly interested in learning about the technical processes involved in the production of Areca products, such as plates, utensils, and other items, and we would like to explore potential collaboration opportunities with your esteemed company.
Specifically, we would like to:
1. Gain a deeper understanding of the machinery and materials required for Areca product manufacturing.
2. Learn about your production techniques, quality control measures, and environmental sustainability practices.
3. Arrange training for our team, either on-site in Vietnam to equip us with the necessary knowledge and skills for Areca product production.
We would greatly appreciate any detailed information, training options, or brochures you can share. Additionally, if there are associated costs for training or collaboration, please let us know.
Thank you for considering our request. I look forward to your response and the opportunity to discuss potential collaboration.
Best Regards,

## History of Vietnamese iced coffee
The coffee plantations during the French colonial period (Photo credit: kinhtedothi.vn)
Coffee made its debut in Vietnam in 1857 during the French colonial period. It was the French who brought coffee to Vietnam, and the first coffee trees were planted in the Central Highlands, also known as Tay Nguyen, because the French thought the soil there was perfect for growing coffee.
At that time, fresh milk was scarce as dairy farming was still in its early stages. So, instead of fresh milk, the French and Vietnamese started using sweetened condensed milk with their dark roast coffee.
Today, Vietnam is a major player in the coffee world. We’re the largest producer of Robusta coffee and the second-largest coffee producer globally

## Quang Tho gotu kola tea, a famous brand in Hue, Vietnam
### Where is Quang Tho commune?
Image: Cong thong tin xa Quang Tho
Quang Tho is a rural commune located on the outskirts of Hue City, the former imperial capital of Vietnam under the [Nguyen Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_dynasty#History) (1802-1945). With an area of 9.49 square kilometers and a population of 6,850 people (as of 2017).
Nestled between two forks of the Bo River, Quang Tho enjoys fertile soil and abundant water, making it perfect for growing all sorts of crops, including short-term industrial plants, food crops, and flowers.
### A thriving hub for gotu kola production
Following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, a handful of families in Quang Tho village ventured into cultivating gotu kola for profit. Witnessing its economic potential, the practice quickly caught on, and today, Quang Tho stands as a significant gotu kola cultivation hub in Vietnam, spanning over 70 hectares of land. Engaging over 604 households, the village has embraced gotu kola production on a large scale.
In support of this growing industry, farmers in Quang Tho have united under the Quang Tho II Agricultural Cooperative. This cooperative helps farmers market their gotu kola produce and drive innovation in gotu kola-based products. With investments in processing machinery, they have expanded into producing gotu kola tea bags, dried tea, and matcha powder, broadening their market reach and economic opportunities.
### Gotu kola farmers in Quang Tho embrace sustainable practices
Gotu kola farmers in Quang Tho are committed to sustainable agriculture. From planting to harvest, they follow strict VietGAP (Vietnamese Good Agricultural Practices) standards. They are also working towards fully organic gotu kola cultivation, with 1.5 hectares already certified organic.
According to Quang Tho II Agricultural Cooperative statistics, the average annual yield is 3,000 tons. Each hectare generates an average income of 200 million Vietnamese dong per year. Gotu kola has helped lift people in Quang Tho out of poverty, with many families becoming prosperous. It has also created stable jobs for hundreds of locals, improving their standard of living.
Quang Tho’s gotu kola products have garnered widespread popularity and were recognized with the [OCOP ](https://vivavn.com/what-is-ocop-vietnam/)4-star certification in 2020. Furthermore, the gotu kola

**Dried gotu kola tea:** A traditional and versatile option for brewing.
**Gotu kola matcha powder:** A unique and contemporary way to experience the flavor and potential health benefits of gotu kola.

### **[Mo Cau Xu Tien: The Startup Turning Areca Leaf Sheaths into Eco-Friendly Plates](https://vivavn.com/mo-cau-xu-tien-the-startup-turning-areca-leaf-sheaths-into-eco-friendly-plates/)**
## Introduction
Photo: Kim Chien / dangcongsan.vn
Originally from South America, the [**water hyacinth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontederia_crassipes) has spread to every continent except Antarctica. Known for its incredibly fast growth, this plant is a vigorous grower, with clusters doubling in size within just one to two weeks.
In [**Vietnam**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam), farmers once used it for animal feed and fertilizer. Today, Vietnamese artisans have turned this plant into beautiful, eco-friendly products. From stylish home decorations to charming souvenirs, these items showcase creativity and environmental consciousness.
## **Background information**
### What is water hyacinth?
Photo: Kim Chien / dangcongsan.vn
Water hyacinth is a floating aquatic plant with broad, thick, glossy, ovate leaves that can rise above the water surface up to 1 meter (3 feet) in height. It has an erect stalk with 8–15 beautiful lavender to pink flowers.
In the blooming season, lakes, rivers, and lagoons are covered with beautiful lavender flowers, creating stunning views. Some people might think they are decorative, but water hyacinths are actually weeds and they have many negative impacts on the environment.
### Environmental impact
In the Mekong Delta, water hyacinths grow so abundantly that they make it difficult for boats to navigate (Photo: Giang Phuong/ Thanh Nien Newspaper).
Water hyacinths **[harm water ecosystems](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937356/)** by depleting oxygen levels and blocking sunlight. Their rapid spread also affects agriculture, fishing, and boat travel. These plants can choke waterways, making it difficult for boats to pass, and they can disrupt local economies dependent on fishing and farming.
**Did you know?** Cutting a water hyacinth into pieces **[doesn’t kill it](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2016/06/01/seven-things-you-didnt-know-about-water-hyacinth/)** — each fragment can grow into a new plant through a process called fragmentation.
In Vietnam, many methods have been adopted to control the spread of water hyacinths, but these efforts have often failed. Vietnamese farmers and artisans have taken a different approach: they harvest water hyacinths to create **[eco-friendly](https://vivavn.com/vietnam-eco-friendly-products/)** handmade products.
## Benefits of handcrafted water hyacinth products

### Sustainability
**Renewable resource** : Water hyacinths are a fast-growing, renewable resource. In Vietnam, they can be harvested in just 4 months, compared to bamboo, which is also a renewable resource but takes at least 2 years to reach maturity. 
**Reduces environmental impact:** By harvesting water hyacinths, we can help control their invasive spread and reduce the need for harsher control methods.
**Locally sourced:** Water hyacinths are often abundant in the regions where they’re turned into products. This reduces transportation needs and the associated carbon footprint compared to materials shipped long distances.
**Eco-friendly craftsmanship:** The entire process, from harvesting to creating handcrafted products from water hyacinth, is done entirely by hand, making it completely eco-friendly
**Natural decomposition:** Water hyacinth products, unlike plastic, are biodegradable and break down naturally, making them a more environmentally friendly choice.
### Durability and quality
**[Water hyacinth fibers](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15280837211067281)** are naturally strong and durable. That’s why handmade products made from water hyacinths can last for years with proper care and protection.
### **Aesthetic appeal**
Water hyacinth products have a natural charm, with soft stalks and a warm, golden-brown outer layer. They bring rustic beauty and modern elegance to items like baskets, furniture, and décor, adding a cozy and organic feel to any space.

## The production process
### **Harvesting**
Harvesting water hyacinth (Photo: QDND Newspaper)
To harvest water hyacinth, the craftsman gets up early and rows out in a boat to collect full-grown plants that are about 3-4 months old. Once harvested, the roots are cut off, and only the stems are kept. These stems are then sun-dried for about 5 days, which helps remove moisture and increases their flexibility.
### Weaving techniques
Source: My nghe Sen Viet – Lotus Handicrafts 
In Vietnam, artisans commonly use eight different weaving styles with water hyacinths. Each style is named based on how the stalks are processed or their appearance after weaving. Each weave is suited for specific product lines, and the production time varies for each style.
Rolled weave
Twisted weave
Arrow weave
Rice nut weave
Open hexagon
Open asterisk
Open zigzag
Close flat weave
A skilled artisan can create 2-3 products per day for simple weaving techniques. However, more complex weaving methods may take several days for an artisan to complete just one product.
### Community impact
**[The Mekong River Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekong_Delta)** in Vietnam is known for its extensive river systems and abundant water hyacinth resources. The local population primarily relies on rice farming, and many households in remote areas still face significant hardships.
Women, in particular, have unstable incomes. During off-season periods, they supplement their earnings by weaving water hyacinths. This additional work helps them improve their financial situation and ease some of their daily challenges.
## Buying and caring for water hyacinth products.

### Care instructions
To get the most out of your water hyacinth products, it’s important to take proper care of them. Here are some key tips for preserving their beauty and durability:
**Sun damage prevention** : Keep water hyacinth items out of direct sunlight to prevent bleaching or damage caused by UV rays. Store them indoors to preserve their appearance.
**Prevent soaking** : Water hyacinth absorbs moisture easily, but it can get moldy and lose its shape if it gets too wet. If it stays moist for a long time, the fibers on the surface can become weak and start to break. To keep these items strong, make sure to dry them well and store them in a dry place, and avoid keeping them wet for too long.
**Regular maintenance:** Taking care of water hyacinth items is easy with regular vacuuming using a brush attachment. Vacuuming helps remove dirt that collects between the fibers and underneath.
Water hyacinth absorbs moisture, which is good, but too much can make it warp or grow mold. Avoid using lots of water to clean it—no steam cleaning or soaking. Just wipe with a damp cloth or gently brush with a soft brush dipped in water. Make sure it’s completely dry after cleaning to keep it in good shape and prevent mold.

Unlike other popular [Vietnamese herbs](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/) such as [Thai basil](https://vivavn.com/thai-basil/), [perilla](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-perilla/), or [piper lolot](https://vivavn.com/piper-lolot/), Vietnamese coriander doesn’t have an immediately strong aroma. But if you simply taste a fresh leaf, you’ll notice bright citrusy and minty notes, followed by a slightly spicy aftertaste that gently lingers on the tongue.
## **Growing and harvesting Vietnamese coriander**
### **Ideal conditions for growing Vietnamese coriander**
Vietnamese coriander is incredibly easy to grow—it even grows wild in many parts of Vietnam. However, for the healthiest and most flavorful leaves, there are a few important growing conditions to keep in mind.
**Soil** : It thrives in loose, nutrient-rich, and consistently moist soil.
**Water** : This herb loves water and doesn’t tolerate drought. Extended periods of heat without regular watering can cause the plant to wither.
**Climate** : Vietnamese coriander grows best in tropical and subtropical climates. It struggles in extreme weather—both intense heat and cold can stunt its growth, and the plant may wither or die under prolonged harsh conditions.
In Vietnam, farmers typically grow Vietnamese coriander either from seeds or, more commonly through stem cuttings. This simple, low-effort method involves selecting healthy stems about 10 to 15 centimeters long, then planting them directly into moist, fertile soil. With regular care, the cuttings quickly develop roots and grow into lush, vibrant plants, ready for harvest in just a few weeks.

### **Harvesting Vietnamese coriander**
Vietnamese coriander grows quickly and can be harvested just **40 days after planting**. Here’s how farmers in Vietnam typically harvest it for continuous growth:
**First Harvest:** Farmers gently trim the stems using a small knife, leaving about 3–5 cm of the stem above the ground. This encourages the plant to regrow healthy new shoots.
**Post-Harvest Care** : After harvesting, the plants are watered regularly and fertilized to stimulate fresh growth for the next round of harvesting.

## **How to use Vietnamese coriander in cooking**
Vietnamese coriander is a versatile ingredient that can be incorporated into a wide range of dishes, adding depth and complexity to flavors. Here are some ways to incorporate this herb into your culinary creations:
**Garnish** : Sprinkle fresh Vietnamese coriander leaves over salads, soups, or grilled meats and vegetables for a burst of flavor and visual appeal.
**Stir-fries and curries** : Add chopped Vietnamese coriander leaves to stir-fries, curries, and other Southeast Asian-inspired dishes for an authentic touch.
## Vietnamese coriander in traditional Vietnamese cuisine
Vietnamese coriander is often used to add a gentle herbal note to various [Vietnamese dishes](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-dishes/). Here are some common ways it appears in local cuisine:

### Soup with crucian carp and Vietnamese coriander (canh ca giec rau ram)

The chef then brings a pot of water to a boil, adds the marinated fish, and lets it cook until the water boils again. Finally, Vietnamese coriander is added to the pot, infusing the soup with its distinctive and aromatic flavor.
### Fertilized duck eggs (hot vit lon)
Fertilized duck eggs, also known as hot vit lon, are a popular street food in Vietnam. These eggs are boiled until fully cooked, and the inside contains a partially developed duck embryo.

## How helicteres hirsuta lour becomes a health tonic
Here is the production process of extracts derived from Helicteres hirsuta lour by An Xuan Company in Cam Lo district:
After about six months of growth, the helicteres hirsuta lour plants reach over a meter tall. Farmers harvest them by carefully cutting all branches and leaves about 15 to 20 centimeters from the base.
The harvested stems and branches are then chopped into small pieces, dried thoroughly, and meticulously washed before being simmered in a lengthy cooking process. This process, from start to finish, takes more than a day. Finally, the resulting liquid concentrate undergoes another 40 hours of freeze drying to remove moisture before being packaged.
## The flavor profile of the product
The product, when brewed with warm water, emits a delightful aroma alongside the steam, with a subtle hint of bitterness.

## History and culture of Vietnamese coffee
Vietnam’s relationship with coffee is deeply rooted in its history, marked by a journey from colonial influence to becoming a global coffee powerhouse. Introduced by French colonialists in the late 19th century, coffee found a perfect environment in Vietnam’s warm and humid climate, quickly becoming a significant crop.
Initially, the French cultivated arabica coffee plants, but by 1925, robusta beans were introduced, paving the way for Vietnam to become the world’s leading producer of robusta coffee.
The early 20th century witnessed the transformation of Vietnam’s coffee industry from small-scale operations to commercial plantations, especially in **[the Central Highlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Highlands_\(Vietnam\))**. The Vietnam War severely disrupted coffee production, almost bringing it to a standstill.
After the war, the new government collectivized agriculture, which initially hindered private enterprise and coffee production. It wasn’t until the Đổi Mới reforms in 1986 that the industry rejuvenated, with the reintroduction of private enterprises that modernized coffee production and improved its quality.
Today, Vietnamese coffee culture is not just about the beverage but is an integral part of the socio-economic fabric of the country. From the bustling streets with vendors selling unique Vietnamese coffee styles like egg coffee and iced coffee to the growth of both traditional and modern cafes, coffee remains central to daily life in Vietnam. The industry not only supports millions of people but also continues to innovate and evolve, contributing significantly to the global coffee market.
## What is a Vietnamese coffee filter?
A Vietnamese coffee filter, also known as a Phin, is a traditional device used to brew Vietnamese coffee. It consists of four main stainless steel parts: a plate, the body, a press disk, and a lid. This simple yet effective tool does not require paper filters or any complicated steps, making it an eco-friendly option for coffee enthusiasts.
### Common types of Phins and their materials
Vietnamese coffee filters come in various materials, each with its characteristics. Understanding these can help you choose the right phin for your coffee brewing needs.

## How to use a Vietnamese coffee filter
### Step-by-step instructions
  1. **Prepare the coffee and filter** : Ensure the coffee is ground specifically for brewing with a Phin filter. The ideal grind should resemble rough grains of sand. Place two tablespoons of coffee into the brew chamber, give it a slight shake to level the grounds, and then place the gravity press on top.
  2. **Pre-wet the coffee** : Add about an ounce of hot water (195-205 degrees F) to the coffee to let it bloom. This should be just enough to cover the filter press by ½ inch. Allow it to bloom for 30-45 seconds. This step is crucial for releasing the gasses from the coffee and helps to enhance flavor extraction.
  3. **Complete the brew** : After the bloom, fill the chamber with additional hot water up to the top. The first drip should occur before 2 minutes, and the brewing process should be completed by around 5 minutes.
  4. **Adjustments** : If the dripping occurs too quickly or too slowly, adjust the grind size of your coffee. A finer grind can slow down the drip, whereas a coarser grind will speed it up.


### Common mistakes to avoid
  * **Ignoring the grind size** : Using the wrong grind size is a common error. If the grind is too coarse, the water will flow through too quickly, resulting in an under-extracted brew. Conversely, too fine a grind can cause over-extraction and a burnt taste.
  * **Not ensuring clean equipment** : Always check that the Phin filter is dry and clean before use. Residual water or debris in the filter holes can prevent proper brewing and affect the taste of your coffee.
  * **Improper water temperature** : Water that is too hot or too cool can significantly affect the extraction process. Always use water between 195-200 degrees F for optimal results.
  * **Uneven coffee grounds** : Failing to level the coffee grounds in the filter can lead to uneven extraction. Gently shake the filter after adding the coffee to distribute the grounds evenly.


## Advantages of using Vietnamese coffee filters
### Cost-effective
Vietnamese coffee filters, notably the  _phin_ , are recognized for their affordability compared to other brewing methods like espresso machines and pour-over setups. The simplicity of the design ensures that there are no costly parts to replace, making it an economically viable option for coffee enthusiasts on a budget.
### Simplicity and portability
One of the standout features of the Vietnamese coffee filter is its ease of use and portability. The  _phin_ is not only straightforward to operate with no complicated parts but also lightweight and compact, making it an ideal companion for travel or daily commutes. This portability is enhanced by the durable materials used in its construction, such as aluminum and stainless steel, which are not only resistant to breakage but can also be reused indefinitely, adding to the filter’s practicality.
### Rich flavor
The Vietnamese  _phin_ coffee filter excels in producing rich, smooth, and strong coffee, which is full-bodied and aromatic. The metal filter facilitates a slow, controlled extraction of coffee oils and flavors, which is crucial for achieving a coffee that is comparable in strength and richness to espresso. This method is particularly effective with robusta beans, which are prevalent in Vietnam and known for their bold, intense flavors.
The versatility of the Vietnamese coffee filter also stands out, as it can be used to brew various types of coffee beverages, from espresso-like drinks to those resembling drip coffee. This adaptability makes the  _phin_ an all-purpose brewing tool suitable for a wide range of coffee preferences.
## Conclusion
Embracing the techniques and history detailed in this guide, enthusiasts can elevate their Vietnamese coffee experience using the traditional phin filter, a simple yet profoundly effective tool in the art of coffee making. Through understanding its cultural significance, mastering the brewing process, and recognizing the unique qualities this method brings to each cup, coffee lovers can savor a truly authentic Vietnamese coffee. The journey from the origins of coffee in Vietnam to the practical application of the phin underscores not only the rich heritage of Vietnamese coffee culture but also its pivotal role in the global coffee scene, offering a distinctive flavor profile cherished by enthusiasts around the world.
Moreover, the exploration of the Vietnamese coffee filter reveals its advantages in producing a rich, aromatic, and robustly flavored coffee that stands out in the world of coffee brewing methods. As individuals continue to seek out genuine, quality coffee experiences, the phin filter remains a testament to Vietnam’s invaluable contribution to coffee culture. By adhering to the guidelines shared, coffee enthusiasts are well-equipped to brew like a pro, fully immersing themselves in the exceptional taste and tradition of Vietnamese coffee, fostering a deeper appreciation for one of Vietnam’s most beloved exports.

FAQs
## What is a loofah?
A loofah is a natural sponge made from the dried fibrous skeleton of the luffa plant—a vine vegetable in the gourd family. As the fruit matures and dries, its inside turns into a dense network of fibers that can be used for gentle exfoliation and cleaning.

In Vietnam, loofah isn’t just used as a sponge. When the fruit is young and tender, it’s actually eaten as a vegetable, often cooked in soups or stir-fried dishes.
## Eco-friendly products made from loofah fibers in Vietnam
When loofah gourds reach full maturity, farmers harvest them and carefully peel off the tough outer skin. What remains is a network of natural fibers that are washed, dried, and prepared for use.
These fibers are turned into practical household items—back scrubbers, soap pouches, bath gloves, dish sponges, and even slippers. It’s a straightforward process that makes use of every part of the plant and provides an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic products.

## Benefits of natural loofah
In [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam), natural loofah has been used for centuries—long before plastic products ever appeared. People relied on it in their daily lives, and over time its value has stood the test of use. Here are some of the key benefits that loofah offers:
### **Gently exfoliates the skin**
Natural loofahs help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Their fibrous texture provides gentle exfoliation—enough to refresh the skin without causing irritation.
### **Made from plants, not plastic**
Loofahs come straight from the earth. Grown from the luffa plant, they are 100% biodegradable and compostable, unlike plastic bath puffs or synthetic sponges that contribute to long-term pollution.
### **Long-lasting when properly cared for**
A natural loofah can last for several weeks with the right care—like keeping it dry between uses and replacing it regularly.
### **Supports sustainable living**
Buying natural loofah products—especially those handmade by artisans or grown organically—encourages responsible consumption and supports eco-friendly practices.
## Frequently asked questions
### Is a loofah a sea sponge?
No. A loofah doesn’t come from the ocean. It’s the dried inner fibers of the luffa gourd, a plant related to cucumbers.
### Are loofahs eco-friendly?
Yes. Loofahs are 100% plant-based, biodegradable, and compostable, making them a sustainable alternative to plastic bath sponges.
### How long does a natural loofah last?
With proper care—like keeping it dry between uses—a loofah can last around 3 to 4 weeks before it should be replaced.

## History and design
Photographer: Huy Dope (facebook.com/huy.h.nguyen.104/)
The Dragon Bridge project commenced on July 19, 2009, and was inaugurated on March 29, 2013. It stands as the sixth bridge spanning the Han River. Preparations for this landmark included a design competition in late 2005, engaging 8 consulting firms from Vietnam, Japan, Germany, and the USA. From 17 proposals, the city leaders selected one depicting a dragon flying over the Han River towards the sea.
Before designing the Dragon Bridge, Vietnamese architects had to find the perfect dragon model. Dragons in each Vietnamese feudal dynasty had unique characteristics. After careful evaluation and analysis, they chose the dragon from the Lý Dynasty as the bridge’s inspiration. They believed the Lý Dynasty dragon exuded strength while maintaining a gentle and graceful form.
## Construction and engineering feats
The Dragon Bridge is an impressive structure, stretching 666 meters long and 37.5 meters wide, with 6 lanes for traffic and 2 lanes for pedestrians. Its distinctive steel structure forms a dragon, stretching 568 meters and weighing almost 9,000 tons, showcasing remarkable engineering prowess.
The entire structure is coated with 5 layers of paint to prevent corrosion. At night, the bridge dazzles with over 2,500 intelligent LED lights, capable of adjusting to suit the themes of different events and festivals.
## Don’t miss the nearby spots after visiting the Dragon Bridge
### Cham Museum
Located about 0.3 km from the Dragon Bridge, The Cham Sculpture Museum in Da Nang is Vietnam’s largest museum showcasing Cham artifacts. It was originally constructed by the French in 1915 and opened to the public in 1919. The museum is home to a rich collection of religious sculptures from the 5th to the 14th-15th centuries, representing the artistic heritage of the Cham civilization.
### APEC Park
Located approximately half a kilometer from the Dragon Bridge, APEC Park is a complex that features greenery, lawns, walking paths, promenades, and fountains. Its standout feature is a Kite-shaped canopy made of nearly 200 tons of steel.
### Han Market
Han Market is situated in the heart of Da Nang city, about 1.4 kilometers from the Dragon Bridge. Established at the beginning of the 20th century, the market has now become the busiest trading hub in Da Nang. It’s considered a paradise for both fashion and food enthusiasts, offering a wide range of shopping and culinary experiences for tourists.
### Da Nang Cathedral (The Pink Church)
Built between February 1923 and March 1924 by the French, Da Nang Cathedral showcases stunning Gothic architecture. Its eye-catching pink facade is a standout. The Cathedral draws in locals and tourists all year round, especially during the festive season.
### The Han River Bridge
The Han River Bridge is the only swing bridge in Vietnam, built over two years from 1998 to 2000. Around 11 p.m., its central section rotates 90 degrees on its axis, aligning with the flow of the river, allowing large boats to pass through. Afterward, the bridge rotates back to its original position. At night, the Han River Bridge is illuminated with changing colors every few minutes, making it vibrant and beautiful.
Big boats don’t come through the Han River as often these days, so the cool bridge rotation doesn’t happen as much anymore. You might only catch it spinning once a week now.
### My Khe Beach
Just 3 kilometers east of the Dragon Bridge is Da Nang’s most renowned beach, My Khe Beach. With its soft white sands and crystal-clear waters, it offers an ideal spot for relaxation and leisure. My Khe Beach is also a perfect spot for catching breathtaking sunrises and sunsets.
### The Sun Wheel
Located in Asia Park, about 5.5 kilometers south of the Dragon Bridge, the Sun Wheel is a gigantic Ferris wheel standing at 115 meters tall. It boasts a total of 64 cabins, each capable of holding up to 6 people. As the wheel rotates, you’ll be treated to a stunning 15-minute panoramic view of Da Nang.
### Helio Night Market
Not far from the Sun Wheel is the Helio Night Market, open daily from 5 pm to 10:30 pm with free entry. Here, you can explore a variety of food stalls offering a delicious taste of Da Nang’s street cuisine. Live music performances sometimes take place outdoors on certain days of the week, while indoor games add to the lively atmosphere, keeping everyone entertained.

Intro to loofah
4 sustainable uses
FAQs
## A quick introduction to loofah
For those unfamiliar with loofah, it comes from a climbing plant in the gourd family. The fruit grows long on trellises, and when it’s young, it has a soft green skin and tender flesh often used in stir-fries or soups in Vietnamese cuisine.
As it matures, the skin becomes hard and brown, while the inside develops a fibrous texture. At this stage, it’s no longer edible but becomes a natural material that can be transformed into eco-friendly household items. Because it’s fully biodegradable, loofah offers a simple, sustainable alternative to plastic.
For more details on loofah, including harvesting and its benefits, check out [our post here](https://vivavn.com/what-is-a-loofah/).

FAQs
## What is Vietnamese cinnamon (Saigon cinnamon)?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** que
**Botanical name:** Cinnamomum loureiroi (not to be confused with Ceylon cinnamon)
**Shape and appearance:** Brown bark, rough exterior when fresh; curls into sticks when dried.
**Flavor profile:** Warm, sweet, and spicy — bolder and more intense than Ceylon cinnamon
**How to enjoy it:** In Vietnam, cinnamon is used in savory dishes like pho and Vietnamese cinnamon pork roll, sweet drinks like cinnamon tea, and also in traditional herbal remedies or essential oil.
Vietnamese cinnamon comes from a tall, aromatic tree native to the highland forests of central and northern Vietnam. These cinnamon trees can grow quite tall—anywhere from 10 to 20 meters—with straight, sturdy trunks and rough, gray-brown bark that holds the fragrant cinnamon beneath the surface.
The leaves are long and slender, often reaching up to 20 centimeters in length and 4 to 6 centimeters wide, with three prominent veins running lengthwise. If you crush a leaf or snap a twig, you’ll notice the signature sweet, spicy aroma—a warm, comforting scent.
Every part of the tree—the bark, branches, and even the leaves—has a pleasant fragrance, but it’s the inner bark that’s prized for its intense flavor and high essential oil content. In Vietnam, farmers typically wait about five years before harvesting the bark, ensuring a rich, complex cinnamon profile that’s sweeter and more pungent than most other varieties.

**Why are Saigon cinnamon and Vietnamese cinnamon considered the same?**
Because they come from the exact same tree, Cinnamomum loureiroi, which is native to Vietnam. The term “Saigon cinnamon” became common in global markets because Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) was the main port where cinnamon was exported from.
So, whether it’s called Saigon cinnamon or Vietnamese cinnamon, it refers to the same sweet, spicy, high-oil-content variety that makes this type of cinnamon so prized in cooking and herbal remedies.
## Popular Vietnamese dishes with cinnamon
### Cinnamon tea (tra que)
Cinnamon tea is a simple yet popular drink in Vietnam, often enjoyed for its warm, soothing flavor. The tea is made by gently simmering cinnamon sticks in water, allowing the spice’s natural sweetness and aroma to infuse the brew. Many like to add a touch of honey or a slice of lemon to enhance the flavor and add a refreshing twist. It’s a comforting beverage, perfect for relaxing moments or to help ease the day’s stress.

### Vietnamese cinnamon pork roll (cha que)
_Cha que_ is a Vietnamese dish with deep roots in Hanoi’s culinary traditions. Known for its fragrant cinnamon flavor and tender texture.
The process of making _cha que_ at home is quite simple: ground pork is seasoned with cinnamon powder and traditional spices, shaped, steamed, then lightly pan-fried for a golden, slightly crispy finish. People can enjoy _cha que_ with plain rice, steamed rice rolls (_banh cuon_), or just by itself.

**Interested in trying Vietnamese cinnamon at home?**
If you’d like to try making Vietnamese cinnamon tea, oatmeal, or even baked treats at home, using high-quality Saigon cinnamon can really bring out the flavor.

### Pho (Vietnamese noodle soup)
_Pho_ is one of the most [well-known dishes](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-dishes/) in Vietnamese cuisine. A bowl of pho brings together a mild, subtly sweet broth with soft, chewy rice noodles, tender slices of beef or chicken, and a fragrant mix of fresh herbs like [Thai basil](https://vivavn.com/thai-basil/). The broth is made by simmering beef bones with a blend of traditional Vietnamese spices. Cinnamon is often added directly to the pot, where it brings a gentle warmth and helps balance the overall flavor.

## Growing and harvesting cinnamon in Vietnam
In Vietnam, cinnamon is usually grown either from seeds or by using cuttings. Most experienced farmers prefer growing from seeds because trees grown from cuttings often produce thinner bark and have lower oil content.
Most farmers don’t start from scratch themselves. Instead, they head to specialized cinnamon nurseries, where young seedlings are cultivated and sold. These nurseries offer healthy, well-rooted young trees that are ready to be transplanted into gardens or farms across Vietnam’s cinnamon-growing regions.
While cinnamon bark can be harvested after around five years, many farmers wait until the trees are 15 to 20 years old. Older trees produce thicker bark with better aroma and flavor.
Many of us are familiar with small cinnamon sticks neatly bundled on store shelves, but those tiny rolls actually come from large, mature trees. When it’s time to harvest, farmers carefully cut sections of the tree trunk and use sharp tools to remove the bark in long strips. The rough outer surface is scraped clean for commercial sale, then the bark is sun-dried and stored. This drying process helps preserve its natural oils and deep, warm aroma.

## Vietnamese cinnamon oil: Benefits beyond the kitchen
Did you know that Vietnamese cinnamon isn’t just used in cooking? Its distinct aroma is also captured in essential oil form. Vietnamese cinnamon essential oil is steam-distilled from the bark of _Cinnamomum loureiroi_ and has a warm, spicy scent with naturally sweet notes. In some cases, the leaves of the cinnamon tree are also distilled to produce a slightly milder oil.
In Vietnam, cinnamon essential oil is often used to freshen the air, ease everyday stress, and support simple skincare routines.

## Frequently asked questions about Vietnamese cinnamon
### Is Vietnamese cinnamon the same as Ceylon cinnamon?
No, they come from different species. Vietnamese cinnamon (_Cinnamomum loureiroi_) is more closely related to cassia than to Ceylon cinnamon. Vietnamese cinnamon is known for its bold, sweet, and spicy flavor, while Ceylon cinnamon is lighter and more delicate.
### Is Vietnamese cinnamon the same as Saigon cinnamon?
Yes, they’re the same! “Saigon cinnamon” is just another name for Vietnamese cinnamon. It was named after Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), which was historically a major export hub for this spice.
### How is Vietnamese cinnamon used in cooking?
You’ll find it in many traditional Vietnamese recipes, including **pho broth** , **cinnamon pork roll (cha que)** , and **cinnamon tea (tra que)**. It can also be added to desserts, baked goods, and stews for a warm, aromatic kick.

## What is winter melon?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** bi dao
**Shape and appearance:** Long, cylindrical; green rind that may be smooth or lightly coated with white fuzz.
**Flavor profile:** mild, bland, and watery, with a neutral taste.
**How to enjoy it:** in Vietnam, winter melon is used in soups, teas, stir-fries, and a candied snack
_A fresh winter melon from Vietnam with a soft white coating and delicate fuzz still visible on its skin._
Winter melon (Benincasa hispida) is a climbing vine native to South and Southeast Asia. It’s grown for its large, edible fruit, which is used in many Asian dishes, especially in countries like [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam) and China.
Also known as wax gourd, white ash gourd, Asian winter melon, Chinese winter melon, or _“bi dao”_ in Vietnamese. It has a green skin that may be coated with soft white fuzz, giving it a frosted or powdery appearance.
In Vietnam, two common types of winter melon are cultivated. One has a green rind with a fine white coating and fuzzy surface, while the other lacks this powdery layer but tends to grow larger and longer, some reaching over 1 meter in length.
Winter melons are usually long and cylindrical in shape, with firm white flesh inside that’s used in both savory and sweet dishes.

Winter melon is technically a fruit—it grows from a flower and contains seeds, which are typical characteristics of fruits. However, in cooking, it’s treated as a vegetable—commonly used in soups and stews rather than eaten sweet or raw.
### The vines, leaves, and flowers of winter melon
Winter melon is a fast-growing vine in [the gourd family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbitaceae). While it can grow along the ground, it’s more commonly supported on a trellis. This method improves air circulation, keeps the fruit clean, and makes harvesting easier.
The plant has large, lobed green leaves and produces bright yellow flowers. These blooms appear along the vine and are essential for pollination and fruit development.

### Taste and flavor of winter melon
If you’ve never tried winter melon before, don’t expect a burst of flavor—because this gourd is all about subtlety. It has virtually no aroma, and when you bite into it, the first impression is its crisp texture and high water content. The taste? Mild, watery, and nearly bland.
But that’s actually what makes winter melon useful in cooking. Its neutral flavor allows it to absorb the taste of the ingredients it’s cooked with. In Vietnamese soups, for example, it picks up the flavors of pork or shrimp broth and adds a clean, refreshing texture to each bite.
## Which part of the winter melon do you eat?
If you’ve never cooked with winter melon before, here’s a quick guide to what’s inside—and what to do with each part:
**Outer rind (inedible):** Tough green skin, usually peeled before cooking.
**White flesh (edible):** Crisp, juicy, and flavor-absorbent—this is the part used in cooking.
**Seed core (discarded):** Soft, spongy center with seeds. Typically removed before cooking.
_A winter melon displayed both crosswise and lengthwise—highlighting its crisp white flesh and pale seeds nestled in the soft core._
In Vietnam, winter melon is prepared by cutting away its thick, firm rind with a sharp knife. The soft inner core containing the seeds is also removed. The remaining white flesh is then sliced, with the thickness depending on the cook’s preference and the type of dish. Thin slices are often used for quick-cooking soups, while thicker chunks may be added to stews.

## Popular Vietnamese dishes with winter melon
Here are some common ways winter melon is used in everyday Vietnamese cooking—simple, light dishes you might enjoy if you’re familiar with the cuisine.
### Winter melon soup with pork ribs (_bi dao ham xuong_)
This simple Vietnamese soup is made with pork ribs, chopped winter melon, and basic seasonings like salt, pepper, shallots, and [fish sauce](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fish-sauce/). Everything is simmered until the ribs are tender and the melon turns soft. Just before serving, the soup is topped with fresh scallion leaves and a few slices of vibrant red chili for a pop of color and extra flavor. It’s a light, healthy dish commonly served with rice in everyday Vietnamese meals.

###  **Winter melon soup with shrimp** (canh bi dao nau tom)
In this Vietnamese dish, peeled shrimp are either minced or left whole, then sautéed with simple seasonings. Once cooked, water is added and brought to a boil. Sliced winter melon is then added and simmered until just tender. The result is a light, naturally sweet soup that’s both refreshing and easy to make.
_Simple yet flavorful—this Vietnamese shrimp and winter melon soup is perfect for hot days or light dinners._
### Vietnamese winter melon tea (tra bi dao)
To make this refreshing drink, mature winter melons are washed, sliced, and sun-dried. Once fully dried, the slices are lightly roasted over low heat to deepen the flavor and preserve them longer. The tea is made by simmering the dried melon slices with rock sugar for about 1 to 1.5 hours until the liquid turns a golden brown. Let it cool, add ice, and enjoy a sweet, cooling beverage perfect for hot days.

### Candied winter melon (mut bi dao)
This traditional Vietnamese treat is especially popular during Tet, the Lunar New Year. It’s made by cutting winter melon into rectangular strips, soaking them in sugar, then gently cooking until a white sugar coating forms on the outside.
The texture is slightly crisp on the outside and chewy inside—translucent, firm, but not too soft. Lightly sweet and refreshing, candied winter melon pairs perfectly with [Vietnamese tea](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-tea/).
## Nutritional highlights of winter melon
Here’s the nutritional breakdown for a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of winter melon, based on [USDA data](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170069/nutrients):

## Growing and harvesting winter melon in Vietnam
Winter melon thrives in tropical climates with warm sunshine and high humidity, like Vietnam. Vietnamese farmers typically grow winter melon between December and March, when the weather is most favorable for this sun-loving vine.
The growing process begins by sowing seeds directly into the soil, followed by building trellises to support the climbing vines. After pollination, the fruit takes around 40 to 50 days to mature. With proper care, a single winter melon plant can produce fruit three to four times during its growing season.
Once harvested, the fruits are taken to local markets, where they’re sold fresh. Thanks to their thick protective skin, winter melons can be stored for several months without spoiling.
Winter melon is an annual plant that lives for about six months. It grows fast in the summer heat, bears fruit, and then naturally dies off as the season ends.

## Origins of Linh Ung Pagoda and the Lady Buddha Statue
Legend has it that during the reign of King Minh Mang (1791-1841), fishermen in Son Tra Peninsula stumbled upon a Buddha statue floating in the sea. Believing it to be an auspicious sign, they erected a shrine to worship the statue. Miraculously, from the time the shrine was established, the seas calmed, and the fishermen enjoyed peaceful fishing seasons. The area where the Buddha statue drifted ashore was named Bai But, meaning “Land of Buddha.”
In 2004, this very land was chosen as the site for the construction of Linh Ung Pagoda. Within the pagoda’s grounds, a majestic statue of the Lady Buddha was erected. People from all walks of life visit to pray for protection and peace

## **Overview**
### What is Tet? An overview of the Lunar New Year in Vietnam
Tet, also known as [Tet Nguyen Dan](https://vivavn.com/what-is-tet/) or the Vietnamese Lunar New Year, is the most significant holiday in Vietnam. It marks the transition from the old year to the new year according to the lunar calendar and usually falls between late January and early February. Tet isn’t just about welcoming the new year—it’s a time for family reunions, honoring ancestors, and wishing for health and prosperity in the year ahead.
During Tet, Vietnamese people follow traditional customs like cleaning their homes, visiting ancestral graves, preparing special offerings, celebrating New Year’s Eve, exchanging well-wishes, and giving children _lucky money_ (li xi). Traditional Vietnamese Tet foods such as _banh chung_ (chung cake), _ga Luoc_ (boiled chicken), and _xoi gac_ (red sticky rice) play a vital role in Tet celebrations.
### The significance of Vietnamese lunar new year food
For Vietnamese people, traditional Tet food is more than just a meal—it’s filled with deep cultural and spiritual meaning. Each dish symbolizes wishes and hopes for the upcoming year.
For example, _banh chung_ and _banh tet_ represent gratitude to ancestors and the balance of heaven and earth with their square and round shapes. Dishes like _xoi gac_ (red sticky rice) symbolize luck and prosperity, while _dua hanh_ (pickled shallots) stand for health. Preparing and sharing these foods strengthens family bonds, shows respect for heritage, and expresses the desire for a prosperous and joyful new year.
In this way, Vietnamese Tet food is not just about food; it’s a powerful symbol of tradition, unity, and optimism during the Lunar New Year celebration.
### Purpose of the post
The goal of this post is to provide you with a clear understanding of Vietnamese Lunar New Year food and the meaning behind each dish. We’ll also introduce you to the key ingredients and traditional Vietnamese spices used in these recipes. By the end of this post, we hope you’ll have a deeper appreciation for the unique flavors and rich culture of Vietnamese cuisine.

## 12 essential dishes in Vietnamese Tet food
### Boiled chicken

**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** Ga luoc 
**Ingredients** : chicken, Vietnamese coriander, onions, carrots, bean sprouts, lime leaves, salt, pepper, monosodium glutamate (MSG), chili powder, fresh chili, lime.
**Significance** : It expresses respect for ancestors and prays for favorable weather and good fortune. 
Vietnamese people hold chickens in high regard, seeing them as symbols of admirable qualities such as strength, courage, and resilience. Because of this deep respect, boiled chicken is an essential dish during Tet, often served on ancestral altars as an offering to honor their ancestors.
In Vietnam, preparing _ga luoc_ (boiled chicken) for Tet starts with selecting a healthy, beautifully shaped chicken. Once chosen, the chicken is carefully slaughtered, and its insides are removed while keeping its form intact. The next step is to boil the chicken in hot water until it’s fully cooked. Once ready, it’s placed on the altar alongside other traditional Tet foods to honor ancestors.
After the ceremony, the chef shreds the chicken by hand into bite-sized pieces. They mix in Vietnamese spices like salt, pepper, MSG, and chili powder, along with fresh Vietnamese herbs such as Vietnamese coriander, chopped lime leaves, onions, carrots, and bean sprouts, finishing it off with a splash of lime juice. The result is a flavorful and vibrant dish.

# Quang Tri Organic Rice: The Journey to Building a Trusted Brand
Introducing the famous organic rice farm in Quang Tri, Vietnam.

_Quang Tri Organic Rice is a brand that was founded in 2017 with a mission to provide customers with safe, high-quality rice that is good for their health. The rice is grown on clean land using pure, non-GMO rice varieties, clean irrigation water, and organic farming and processing methods._
## Introduction
Image: QTOrganic
Quang Tri is a coastal province in central Vietnam. For generations, the people of Quang Tri have depended on agriculture for their livelihood, with rice farming being the primary source of income. In 2023, the province had nearly 28,000 hectares of land dedicated to rice cultivation.
It wasn’t until 2017 that [organic rice](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-organic-rice/) production was first introduced to Quang Tri. The pioneer in this field was a startup called QTOrganic. Through years of dedication and innovation, QTOrganic has successfully built a brand known as “Quang Tri Organic Rice.”
## The Story of Quang Tri Organic Rice
Pham Thi Diem Le – the founder of QTOrganic
In 2016, Pham Thi Diem Le, a native of Quang Tri province, Vietnam, was living in Ho Chi Minh City. She felt suffocated by the hustle and bustle of city life. Longing for a simpler existence, she decided to return to her hometown.
Diem Le brought with her a wealth of knowledge and experience in the agricultural sector. She dreamed of using her expertise to develop an organic rice brand right where she was born.
Pham Thi Diem Le remembers the journey of building Quang Tri Organic Rice with a bittersweet smile. It was a path filled with immense challenges, but ultimately, incredibly rewarding.
The biggest hurdle initially was convincing local farmers to abandon traditional, inorganic methods and embrace a new, organic approach. Fear of failure and uncertainty made them hesitant at first. Diem Le persevered, patiently explaining the benefits of organic farming.
Slowly but surely, Diem Le’s dedication paid off. What began with a handful of farmers tending a few dozen hectares has blossomed into a thriving operation spanning over 200 [hectares ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare)by early 2024. Today, farmers proudly see their organic rice embraced by both domestic and international markets.
A significant milestone was achieved in early 2023 when over 15 tons of “Quang Tri Organic Rice” were exported to Europe for the first time. This success is a testament to Le’s vision and the hard work of the farmers. It also serves as a powerful motivator to continue producing high-quality organic rice and conquer an even bigger market share on the global stage.
In 2019, researchers from Hiroshima University in Japan found that organic rice grown in Quang Tri province, Vietnam contains two rare and valuable compounds: Momilactone A and Momilactone B (MA and MB). These compounds have been shown to have anti-diabetic, anti-gout, and anti-obesity properties.

## What are coconut shell products?
Coconut shell products are everyday items made from the hard outer shell of mature coconuts. Instead of letting this natural material go to waste, skilled artisans transform it into bowls, candles, home décor, and even bird nests.
Each coconut shell is unique in shape and texture, giving every finished product its natural beauty. These items are not only durable and lightweight but also biodegradable and plastic-free, making them a favorite among eco-conscious shoppers.
Most coconut shell products are handmade, often in countries like Vietnam, where [**coconut farming**](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coconut/) is common. By using a material that would otherwise be discarded, these products support zero-waste living and promote sustainable craftsmanship.

## How coconut shell products are made
The process starts by collecting discarded coconut shells, which are cleaned, dried, and hand-cut by artisans. The shells are then sanded smooth, shaped into bowls or other items, and polished using natural oils like coconut oil. This simple, low-waste process keeps the natural texture while turning each shell into a unique, eco-friendly product.

## How to use and care for coconut kitchenware
### **How to use coconut bowls and utensils**
Coconut shell kitchenware is perfect for serving salads, smoothie bowls, rice dishes, and snacks. However, keep in mind—they’re not designed for high heat or the microwave. Think of them more like wooden bowls—natural and beautiful, but a little more delicate.
### **How to wash and dry**
After each use, wash your coconut bowls by hand with lukewarm water and mild soap. Avoid soaking them for long periods, as this may cause the natural shell to deteriorate over time.
### **How to keep them looking new**
Like all natural materials, coconut kitchenware needs a little love now and then. If the surface starts looking dull or rough, rub in a bit of coconut oil to restore its natural shine.
### **A note on sustainability**
Coconut bowls are made from discarded coconut shells, turning waste into beauty. By caring for them properly, you not only keep them longer but also reduce waste. Every time you reuse your coconut bowl, you’re making a more sustainable choice.
## Frequently asked questions about coconut shell products
### Are coconut shell products really eco-friendly?
Yes, they are. Coconut shell products are made from discarded coconut shells that would otherwise go to waste. By repurposing them into bowls or decor, we reduce agricultural waste and support a circular economy.
### Do coconut shell products have a smell or taste?
Nope! A properly cleaned and polished coconut bowl has no noticeable coconut smell or flavor. You can safely serve all kinds of food without any impact on taste.
### How long do coconut shell products last?
With proper care, coconut bowls and utensils can last for years. They’re durable and can handle daily use if kept dry and oiled occasionally.
### Can I use coconut shell products for outdoor or camping trips?
Absolutely! Coconut bowls and utensils are lightweight and natural—perfect for eco-friendly camping, picnics, or van life. Just be sure to keep them dry after use.

#### Aroma and flavor
Vietnamese perilla has a bold, peppery fragrance with subtle hints of mint, anise, and basil. Its taste is slightly spicy with a mild herbal sweetness. This strong aroma is a key reason it’s prized in cooking and herbal medicine.
## Cultivating and harvesting Vietnamese perilla
### **Ideal climate and soil conditions**
Vietnamese perilla grows best in warm weather. In Vietnam’s tropical climate, it can be cultivated year-round, but the plant grows most vigorously from March to September when temperatures are high and rainfall is moderate. It prefers loose, fertile soil with good drainage and can grow in full sun or partial shade. While the plant loves moisture, it doesn’t tolerate waterlogged soil, so proper drainage is essential to keep the roots healthy.

### **Harvesting and care tips**
During hot, sunny days, water Vietnamese perilla twice a day—once in the morning and once in the late afternoon. From the time of sowing, it typically takes about 35 to 40 days for the first harvest. In Vietnam, farmers usually harvest by trimming the top stems. About a week later, the plant regrows and is ready for the next round of harvesting.

## Health benefits of Vietnamese perilla
Vietnamese perilla is more than just a flavorful herb—it’s long been recognized in traditional Asian medicine for its wide-ranging health benefits. According to recent scientific studies, _Perilla_ contains numerous bioactive compounds that offer powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties [(Wu et al., 2023)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10394348/).
### **Anti-inflammatory and respiratory support**
Compounds such as perilla ketone (PK) and rosmarinic acid found in the leaves help suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6. These effects may support relief from conditions such as allergic reactions, asthma, and chronic respiratory inflammation.
### **Antioxidant protection**
Perilla leaves are rich in flavonoids and phenolic acids, known antioxidants that help protect cells from oxidative stress and age-related damage. This may contribute to better cardiovascular, skin, and immune health.
### **Antimicrobial and antifungal activity**
Essential oils from _Perilla frutescens_ have been shown to inhibit bacterial growth and prolong the shelf life of food by disrupting harmful microorganisms, especially _Candida albicans_ and _Enterococcus faecalis_.
### **Mood and brain support**
Animal studies suggest that long-term intake of perilla seed oil or extracts may help reduce depressive symptoms by regulating brain inflammation and boosting neurotrophic factors, offering a natural option for supporting emotional well-being.
### **Other benefits**
Research also highlights potential effects in supporting weight management, bone health, digestive health, and even cancer prevention. These findings are still emerging but show great promise for the future of perilla as both food and functional medicine.
## Culinary uses of Vietnamese perilla
Vietnamese perilla leaves are commonly used fresh in herb platters, added to soups, or cooked with meat and seafood to enhance flavor. Their bold aroma helps balance strong ingredients, and the herb is also valued in traditional remedies.
### Perilla as part of Vietnamese fresh herb platters
In many Vietnamese noodle dishes like bun cha, bun bo Hue, or bun thit nuong, a plate of fresh herbs is always served on the side, and Vietnamese perilla is almost always part of it. Its bold, slightly peppery flavor pairs well with other [Vietnamese herbs](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/) like fish mint, coriander, and [Thai basil](https://vivavn.com/thai-basil/), adding brightness and complexity to every bite.

### **Fried perilla pork rolls**
Another creative way to enjoy Vietnamese perilla is by using its leaves to wrap seasoned ground pork. The rolls are then pan-fried until crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The perilla leaves not only hold the filling together but also infuse the meat with a rich, herbal aroma.

### **Using perilla leaves in rice porridge to ease cold symptoms**
A common remedy in Vietnamese folk medicine for colds is a bowl of rice porridge cooked with perilla leaves, shallots, and a dash of crushed black pepper. It’s typically eaten while still warm, as the steam and herbal aroma are believed to help relieve early symptoms of illness.
### **Brewing perilla tea with fresh or dried leaves**
In Vietnam, perilla tea is often made using fresh leaves, dried leaves, or even powdered perilla leaves. The leaves are steeped in hot water to create a light, herbal infusion that’s traditionally used to help ease digestion, reduce stress, and promote relaxation.

FAQs
## What is pennywort (gotu kola)?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** rau ma
**Shape and appearance:** small, kidney-shaped leaves with scalloped edges, growing on slender green stems; often forming dense mats close to the ground.
**Flavor profile:** mildly grassy and slightly bitter, with refreshing earthy undertones. 
**How to enjoy it:** In Vietnam, pennywort is enjoyed fresh in drinks, soups, and salads. It’s also dried for tea or ground into powder for drinks and skincare.
### Shape and appearance
Pennywort (gotu kola) is a low-growing, creeping herb with soft, slender stems that are pale green or slightly purplish. Its leaves are kidney-shaped, smooth, and a darker green than the stems, with scalloped edges. The plant often spreads out to form a lush green carpet close to the ground, though in ideal conditions, it can grow upright to a height of 30 to 40 centimeters. In Vietnam, farmers typically harvest pennywort when it reaches about 15 to 20 centimeters tall—just the right size for optimal flavor and texture in tea and cooking.

### Where does gotu kola grow in Vietnam?
Gotu kola is a hardy herb that thrives in Vietnam’s warm, humid climate. It grows easily in home gardens, along village paths, and near ponds or lakes—anywhere with moist, shaded soil. In many rural areas, families grow pennywort for daily use or local markets. Some villages even specialize in cultivating this herb to supply ingredients for traditional teas and health drinks. One well-known example is [Quang Tho](https://en.vietnamplus.vn/gotu-kola-plant-earns-hue-farmers-a-decent-life-post126870.vnp), a farming community in the city of Hue, Central Vietnam, where farmers have built a reputation around growing high-quality pennywort.

### Taste and flavor
Fresh pennywort leaves have a distinct herbal aroma that some might find unfamiliar at first. When cooked at high heat, the aroma becomes even more pronounced. The taste is mildly bitter, but it often leaves a subtle, pleasant sweetness on the palate after each sip or bite.
## Cultivating and harvesting pennywort (gotu kola) in Vietnam
Pennywort (gotu kola) thrives in a variety of soil conditions, but for the best yield, Vietnamese farmers prefer to grow it in loose, nutrient-rich soil. The herb can be propagated either by planting root segments or sowing seeds, with seed propagation being more common for large-scale cultivation.
After sowing, the plants typically take about two to three months to reach maturity for the first harvest. During harvesting, farmers cut the stems about 3 to 4 centimeters above the ground to encourage regrowth. The plant regenerates quickly, allowing for subsequent harvests roughly every 15 days.

## Culinary uses of pennywort in Vietnam
### Vietnamese pennywort and shrimp soup (canh ra ma nau tom)
One traditional way to enjoy pennywort in Vietnam is in a light soup cooked with shrimp. Known as _“canh rau ma nau tom”_ , this comforting, home-style dish begins by sautéing seasoned shrimp with shallots until fragrant. Water is then added and brought to a boil to create a flavorful base. Finally, fresh pennywort leaves are added and briefly simmered just until tender. The result is a clear, nourishing broth with a mildly bitter, slightly sweet, and refreshing flavor, often enjoyed with rice.

### Pennywort tea (tra rau ma)
One popular way to enjoy pennywort in Vietnam is as a **Vietnamese herbal tea**. Dried leaves are gently simmered in hot water for about 5 to 7 minutes until the brew takes on an earthy golden-brown hue. The liquid is then strained and can be enjoyed either warm or chilled. A touch of honey adds a natural sweetness, making this tea a refreshing option for hot afternoons.

### Pennywort and mung bean smoothie (sinh to rau ma dau xanh)
In Vietnam, pennywort is often turned into a refreshing green drink. One popular version mixes it with mung beans and sweetened condensed milk to create a creamy, cooling smoothie that’s both tasty and nourishing.
Here’s a simple idea of how it’s made:
Fresh pennywort leaves are blended with water, then strained to get the juice.
Soft-cooked mung beans are added for a smooth, nutty flavor.
A bit of sweetened condensed milk gives it a creamy and lightly sweet taste.
Everything is blended into a smooth, creamy drink that’s gently sweet, a little grassy, and naturally refreshing. Pour it over ice and enjoy it on a hot day.
## How pennywort is used in traditional Vietnamese remedies
**Note before we begin:**
These uses of pennywort come from traditional Vietnamese folk remedies passed down for generations. Though still popular, they aren’t backed by modern medical research. So, think of them as cultural insights rather than medical advice.
In traditional Vietnamese remedies, pennywort is often consumed as a fresh juice to help relieve skin irritations, rashes, and acne. Some believe that drinking it daily can cool the body and support detoxification. It’s also a common ingredient in homemade beauty routines, with people claiming that it improves skin clarity and promotes a healthy glow. _(Sources:[Vinmec](https://www.vinmec.com/vie/bai-viet/rau-ma-co-tac-dung-gi-voi-suc-khoe-vi), [Thanh Niên Newspaper](https://thanhnien.vn/chi-can-mot-nam-rau-ma-duong-da-min-mang-trang-sang-185771833.htm#:~:text=B%E1%BA%A1n%20ch%E1%BB%89%20c%E1%BA%A7n%20l%E1%BA%A5y%20m%E1%BB%99t,%C4%91%C6%B0%E1%BB%A3c%20l%C3%A0n%20da%20l%C3%A1ng%20m%E1%BB%8Bn.) – articles in Vietnamese)_

**Powdered:** Dried pennywort is sometimes ground into a fine green powder, often labeled as “pennywort powder” or “Centella asiatica powder.” This form is used to make instant herbal drinks. It’s also popular in natural skincare routines, mixed into face masks to help soothe the skin and promote a clearer complexion.

## What is lychee?
Lychee (_Litchi chinensis_), called “vai” or “vai thieu” in Vietnamese, is a tropical fruit known for its sweet, floral flavor and juicy, jelly-like texture. It has a rough, pinkish-red skin that you peel away to reveal translucent white flesh and a shiny brown seed inside.

## What is longan?
Longan (_Dimocarpus longan_), called “nhan” or “long nhan” in Vietnamese, is a small, round tropical fruit. Often called the “dragon’s eye” due to its translucent flesh and dark seeds, the longan belongs to the same family as the lychee and rambutan. It has a thin, light brown shell that’s easy to peel, revealing juicy, white flesh inside.

## What lychee and longan have in common
Lychee and longan are often compared — and for good reason. Both are [tropical fruits](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/) native to Asia, part of the [soapberry family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapindaceae) (Sapindaceae), and packed with juicy, sweet flesh that’s refreshing. When peeled, they look quite similar: white flesh surrounding a shiny seed at the center.
They’re also both summer fruits and are often enjoyed fresh, added to desserts, or used in Asian drinks and sweet soups. Nutritionally, lychee and longan are low in fat, hydrating, and a good source of vitamin C and antioxidants.

## **Key differences between lychee and longan**
### **Appearance comparison**
At first glance, lychees and longans are easy to tell apart. Lychees are noticeably larger than longans and have a rough, bumpy skin that ranges from pink to red, covered in small, raised nodules that give it a distinct textured appearance. Longans, on the other hand, are smaller and have smooth, light brown skin that’s often speckled with tiny dark dots, giving them a lightly freckled look.

### **Flesh comparison**
Both fruits have translucent white flesh, but with subtle differences. Lychee flesh is thicker, juicier, and slightly more opaque. It feels soft and tender when you bite into it. Longan flesh is a bit firmer and more translucent, sometimes allowing you to see the seed through the fruit. It has a slightly crisper texture compared to lychee.

### **Taste comparison**
Both fruits are sweet, but they offer distinct flavor profiles and textures. Lychee is juicy and sweet, with a light floral aroma and a gentle tang that feels refreshing and bright. It’s juicier than longan and has a clean, delicate scent without any musky notes. Longans are also sweet, with a juicy texture that carries just a bit of crispness. Longans don’t have any tangy or sour notes—just pure sweetness with a subtle musky aftertaste that lingers on your tongue.

## What is the fruit lychee?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** vai, vai thieu
**Shape and appearance:** small, round to slightly oval, with rough red to pink skin; inside is translucent white flesh that surrounds a single dark seed.
**Flavor profile:** juicy and sweet, with a light floral aroma and a gentle tang.
**How to enjoy it:** Enjoy lychees fresh, in tea, sweet soups, or tropical desserts—or try them dried, in smoothies, or even stir-fried with rice for a creative twist.
**Harvest season:** lychee is harvested from May to July in Vietnam.
### Shape and color of lychee
Lychee is a round or slightly oval fruit, usually about 3 to 5 centimeters long and around 3 centimeters in diameter. Its outer skin is rough and bumpy, covered in small, raised nodules. When ripe, the skin turns pink to red, with a textured surface that feels slightly dry to the touch. This appearance is typical of fresh Vietnamese lychees at peak ripeness.
_This image shows ripe Vietnamese lychees with their pink-red skin and bumpy texture, indicating they’re ready to eat._
Earlier in the growing season, lychees are still green and firm. As they ripen on the tree, the skin gradually changes color, and the fruit inside becomes juicy, sweet, and aromatic. Being able to spot this change is helpful whether you’re harvesting them fresh or shopping at a local market.
_This image shows unripe lychee fruits still hanging on the tree, with firm green skin and a bumpy texture._
_This image shows the actual size of a typical lychee, with a ruler used to measure both its length and diameter._
### What’s inside a lychee
Inside a lychee, you’ll find thick, soft, and translucent flesh. At the center is a single smooth, brown seed, which isn’t edible. It’s the refreshing white flesh that people love—perfect for snacking, desserts, or tropical drinks.

## Taste and flavor of lychee
### Sweetness and aroma
Ripe lychees have a naturally rich sweetness with a hint of tartness. The flesh is soft, juicy, and refreshing. In Vietnam, lychees from [Luc Ngan, Bac Giang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%A5c_Ng%E1%BA%A1n_district#:~:text=L%E1%BB%A5c%20Ng%E1%BA%A1n%20is%20a%20rural,area%20of%201%2C012%20km2.) – one of the country’s most renowned lychee-growing regions – are prized for their floral aroma, tender texture, and deep sweetness, with a natural sugar content (Brix level) ranging from **18% to 21%** [source (Vietnamese)](https://baobacgiang.vn/bg/kinh-te/137286/ky-thuat-trong-vai-thieu-luc-ngan.html).
**Brix Level (°Bx)** measures the sugar content in a liquid as a percentage. One degree Brix equals 1 gram of sugar (specifically sucrose) in 100 grams of liquid. It’s a common way to gauge how sweet things like fruit, juice, wine, and honey are. The higher the Brix level, the sweeter the product.
_A peeled lychee reveals its juicy, translucent flesh—sweet, fragrant, and ready to enjoy._
### Comparison to other fruits
Lychee is often compared to grapes because of its juicy texture and sweetness. But it has a floral aroma that sets it apart. Some say it tastes like a mix between a grape and a rose petal, with a subtle tang that’s somewhat similar to strawberry. Compared to [longan](https://vivavn.com/longan/), lychee is juicier and has a lighter, more refreshing scent, without the musky smell that longan naturally has. If you like fruits such as pears, grapes, strawberries, or [rambutan](https://vivavn.com/rambutan/), lychee is likely to be a refreshing favorite.

_Side by side: A bunch of lychees and longans showing their clear differences in size, skin texture, and color._
## When is lychee in season?
In Vietnam, lychee season runs from May to July, which is early summer to mid-summer. This is when the fruit is at its best—juicy, fragrant, and full of flavor.
The harvest is concentrated in northern provinces, especially Bac Giang and Hai Duong, where the climate and soil are ideal for growing lychee. In these regions, the season usually begins in early to mid-May, peaks in June, and wraps up by early July.
If you want to enjoy Vietnamese lychees at their freshest, the best time is from late May to mid-June, when they are widely available in markets and at their peak sweetness.
_This image shows lychee fruits on the tree in Vietnam as they begin to ripen._
## **How lychee is grown and harvested in Vietnam**
### Growing conditions for lychee in Vietnam
Lychee trees thrive in tropical and subtropical climates without frost. While they need warm, humid conditions to grow, they also require a short period of cooler weather to start flowering. In Vietnam, temperatures between 11°C and 14°C for several days during winter help trigger the flowering stage. This natural chill is essential for proper bud development and ensures better fruit production in the following season.
Because of this climate requirement, lychee is only grown commercially in northern Vietnam, where the winter temperatures are suitable for flower initiation. The two main provinces known for lychee production are [Bac Giang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%E1%BA%AFc_Giang_province) and [Hai Duong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E1%BA%A3i_D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng_province), which are famous for both the quality and quantity of their lychees.

### Harvesting lychee in Vietnam
Farmers care for the trees year-round, from pruning branches to monitoring for pests. No large machinery is used—almost everything is done by hand. When lychees start to ripen between May and July, they’re carefully picked by hand to avoid damaging the thin skin. This hands-on approach helps keep the fruit fresh and in good condition for the market.

## **How lychee is used in Vietnamese culture, medicine, and cuisine**
### The cultural significance of lychee in Vietnam
In Vietnam, lychee isn’t just a summer fruit—it’s a symbol of prosperity, health, and good fortune. The fruit’s red skin is especially meaningful in Vietnamese culture, where the color red represents luck and happiness.
During **[Tet Doan Ngo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E1%BA%BFt_%C4%90oan_Ng%E1%BB%8D)** , celebrated on the 5th day of the 5th lunar month, lychee is commonly placed on the family altar along with other traditional [**Vietnamese fruits**](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/). Offering a bunch of fresh lychees is a way to honor loved ones who have passed and to pray for health and blessings in the months ahead.
Beyond its role in tradition, lychee is a source of national pride. Its striking appearance, floral aroma, and sweet, juicy taste are unlike any other fruit, and many Vietnamese believe that nowhere in the world produces lychees quite like Vietnam

### Traditional medicinal uses of lychee
**Note before we begin:**
These uses of lychee come from traditional Vietnamese folk remedies passed down through generations. While people still enjoy them today, they’re not backed by modern medical research, so think of them as cultural insights rather than medical advice.
In Vietnamese folk remedies, nearly every part of the lychee fruit has its own traditional use:
L**ychee peel** is often dried and boiled into a tea believed to help cool the body and support detoxification.
**Fresh or dried lychee flesh** is traditionally used to ease fatigue—both mental and physical—and is thought to help with muscle soreness, especially in the shoulders and lower back.
**Lychee seeds** , when dried, crushed, or boiled, have been used to relieve stomach discomfort, soothe toothaches, and support blood sugar balance.
### Lychee in traditional Vietnamese cuisine
#### Dried lychees: Sweet, chewy, and long-lasting
While fresh lychees are perfect for snacking and summer drinks, drying them is a great way to preserve their unique flavor. In Vietnam, the fruits are often dried with the skin still on. During the process, the flesh gradually darkens and develops a chewy texture with rich, caramel-like sweetness. It’s a traditional method, especially popular during lychee season, and it makes for a delicious treat that lasts well beyond summer
#### Lychee tea
Lychee tea is a refreshing summer drink that blends the floral sweetness of lychee with the slight bitterness of brewed tea. Typically made with fresh lychees, oolong tea, and rock sugar, it’s chilled and served over ice—perfect for beating the tropical heat. Popular during lychee season, this drink is both flavorful and easy to make at home.

#### Lychee and lotus seed sweet soup
This light and soothing dessert combines tender lotus seeds with juicy lychee for a naturally sweet treat. The lotus seeds are gently simmered until soft, then tucked into peeled lychees before being briefly cooked in a fragrant syrup. It’s a popular summertime dish in Vietnam—cool, refreshing, and simple to make at home.
#### Lychee fried rice
This creative Vietnamese dish brings a tropical twist to classic fried rice. Originating from the Mekong Delta, it’s made by stir-frying steamed rice with juicy lychee, eggs, and savory ingredients like sausage or char siu. As everything sizzles together in the pan, the lychee softens and releases a gentle sweetness that blends beautifully with the richness of the rice and proteins

### [Vietnamese Coconut Nectar: Sokfarm’s Sustainable Sweetener](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coconut-nectar/)
## Introduction
**[Vietnamese coffee](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coffee/)** is beloved worldwide, not just for its traditional phin-brewed variety but also for its instant coffee. This article will delve into the origins of coffee in Vietnam and the emergence of instant coffee in this coffee-loving nation.
We’ll highlight what makes Vietnamese instant coffee unique, from its creation process to the distinctive smooth and creamy flavor it offers. You’ll also discover popular brands, the benefits of Vietnamese instant coffee, and where to buy it. Whether you’re a coffee enthusiast or simply curious, this guide will provide you with everything you need to appreciate and enjoy Vietnamese instant coffee.
## History of Vietnamese Instant Coffee
In the 19th century, the French brought coffee and [**the phin filter**](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coffee-filters/) to Vietnam. The phin has since become an iconic part of Vietnamese coffee culture. Its slow extraction process results in a uniquely rich and aromatic coffee, but this method requires time, making it less convenient for those with busy lifestyles.
The birth of Vietnamese instant coffee can be traced back to the establishment of the Vinacafe factory in 1969. This convenient alternative to traditional phin coffee quickly became popular. Instant coffee, which only requires hot water, offers a quicker and simpler way to enjoy coffee compared to the time-consuming phin method. Exported internationally, it’s loved for its rich, flavorful taste. Today, Vietnamese instant coffee remains a favorite for its convenience and delightful aroma.
## The Advantages of Vietnamese Instant Coffee
**Convenience** : One of the most significant advantages of Vietnamese Instant Coffee is its unparalleled convenience. Whether you’re on the go, at the office, or simply seeking a quick caffeine fix, this instant coffee offers a hassle-free solution. With just a few simple steps, you can enjoy a rich and flavorful cup of coffee anytime, anywhere.
**Authentic Flavor** : Despite its convenience, Vietnamese Instant Coffee does not compromise on flavor. The meticulous roasting and blending process ensures that the authentic taste of Vietnamese coffee is preserved, allowing you to savor the rich, bold, and slightly sweet notes that have made this brew so beloved.
**Affordability** : Vietnamese Instant Coffee is a budget-friendly option that doesn’t sacrifice quality. Its affordability makes it accessible to coffee lovers from all walks of life, ensuring that everyone can indulge in the unique flavors of this exceptional brew without breaking the bank.
## What makes Vietnamese Instant Coffee Unique?
Vietnamese instant coffee stands out for its distinctive flavor profile, which differs markedly from typical instant coffees. Unlike the often burnt and overly sweet taste of many instant brands, Vietnamese instant coffee offers a unique flavor with a harmonious balance of ingredients. This unique profile is largely due to the use of robusta coffee beans, which thrive in Vietnam’s ideal climate and soil conditions. Robusta beans contribute to the coffee’s rich, full-bodied flavor and robust characteristics.
The balance of these flavors ensures that the coffee is not overly sweet. Its well-balanced creaminess provides a smooth, satisfying taste without being overwhelming. Each cup delivers a delightful and well-rounded coffee experience, reflecting the exceptional growing conditions and the cultural emphasis on quality and flavor in Vietnamese coffee.
## Popular Vietnamese Instant Coffee Brands
The market is brimming with a variety of Vietnamese Instant Coffee brands, each offering its unique take on this beloved beverage. Some of the best Vietnamese instant coffee options such as:
### Trung Nguyen

Renowned for its Vietnamese drip coffee and premium products, Trung Nguyen also offers high-quality instant coffee. With its unique flavors now enjoyed in over 60 countries, Trung Nguyen stands as a true icon of Vietnamese coffee culture.
Trung Nguyên’s G7 instant coffee line offers a taste of Vietnam’s best coffee. The G7 3-in-1 combines coffee, cream, and sugar from Buon Ma Thuot’s legendary soil.

## How to Prepare Vietnamese Instant Coffee
Preparing Vietnamese Instant Coffee is a breeze, making it an ideal choice for those on the go or with limited time. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide:
**Gather your ingredients:** Vietnamese instant coffee generally comes in two types. The first type is pre-mixed with sugar, milk, and cream, so you don’t need to add anything extra—just mix with hot water. The second type is 100% coffee, where you can add your own sweeteners, milk, or cream according to your taste preferences.
**Mix the coffee:** In a mug or glass, combine the desired amount of Vietnamese Instant Coffee powder with a small amount of hot (or cold) water. Stir until the powder is fully dissolved, creating a concentrated coffee mixture.
**Add your extras:** If you prefer your coffee sweetened or with milk/creamer, now is the time to incorporate those ingredients. Adjust the amounts to your taste preferences.
**Top it off:** Finally, fill your mug or glass with the remaining hot (or cold) water, giving it a gentle stir to ensure everything is well combined.
**Enjoy:** Sit back, relax, and savor the rich, aromatic flavors of your freshly prepared Vietnamese Instant Coffee.
## Where to Buy Vietnamese Instant Coffee
Here are some options for purchasing Vietnamese Instant Coffee:
**Vietnamese markets:** If you have access to a Vietnamese market or community, these stores are likely to have an extensive selection of authentic Vietnamese Instant Coffee brands.
**Online retailers:** Major online retailers like Amazon, eBay, and various specialty coffee websites offer a wide range of Vietnamese Instant Coffee options, often with convenient shipping options.

# Vietnamese Lotus Tea: A Unique and Captivating Beverage
[](https://vivavn.com/category/discover/)
4 min
[](https://vivavn.com/tea/)
Tea
_In Vietnam, lotus tea symbolizes the essence of[ Vietnamese tea ](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-tea/)culture. This unique tea boasts a captivating flavor and is crafted through a meticulous process that’s almost like an art form!_
## When did Vietnamese lotus tea originate?
Up to now, there isn’t any document that accurately states when Vietnamese lotus tea originated. However, according to Vietnamese folklore, lotus tea has been around for a long time. It’s said that during the Nguyen dynasty in Hue, the kings often ordered servants to row boats to lotus ponds to select the most fragrant lotus blossoms for making lotus tea.
During the summer months, during the time of the Nguyen Dynasty emperors. Highly skilled servants would row out to the middle of the lotus pond at night and find the perfect buds. They would carefully place the tea leaves inside each flower and tie them shut with thin [bamboo ](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-bamboo/)strips.
The next morning, the servants would return to the pond and collect the tea. They would then use the dew that had gathered on the lotus leaves to boil water and brew the tea. This special process infused the tea with the delicate and unique fragrance of the lotus flower, creating a truly delightful cup of tea.
## There are two main ways Vietnamese people make lotus tea today
To make delicious lotus tea, Vietnamese people believe that the lotus flowers must be harvested in the early morning, just as they are beginning to bloom. This is the time when the flowers are most fragrant.
The harvesting process must be done very carefully to avoid damaging the delicate petals. After harvesting the lotus flowers, Vietnamese people have two ways to make lotus tea:
### The first way
**1. Nesting the Tea Leaves:** The process begins with carefully tucking tea leaves inside the unopened lotus buds.
**2**. **Protective Wrap:** To further protect the delicate contents, the entire bud is then wrapped in a layer of fresh lotus leaves.
**3. Securing the Bud:** Once the bud is wrapped in lotus leaves, a thin bamboo strip is used to tie it shut.
**4. Overnight Infusion:** The final step is to leave the wrapped lotus bud to rest overnight. During this time, the tea leaves gently absorb the wonderful essence of the lotus flower. The fragrance and flavors slowly transfer from the flower to the tea leaves, creating the unique taste of lotus tea.
### The second way
This is a meticulous method of making lotus tea, but the resulting flavor will be exquisite and can be enjoyed throughout the year.
**1. Separating Stamens:** This step focuses on carefully harvesting the fragrant part of the lotus flower.
– The tea maker starts by gently opening the unopened lotus buds.
– They then meticulously **extract** the stamens, which are the male reproductive organs of the flower.
– Importantly, they only select the **white portion** of the stamen, which is likely the most flavorful part.
**2. Infusing the Tea:** This step focuses on transferring the lotus flower’s essence to the tea leaves.
– The extracted white stamen is placed directly into green tea leaves.
– This mixture is left for **several days** , allowing the flavors to **meld together**.
– During this infusion process, the delicate aroma and taste of the lotus flower are absorbed by the green tea leaves.
**3. Separating the green tea leaves from the stamen:** This step ensures the final tea doesn’t contain unwanted elements.
– The tea maker uses a **traditional tool** to separate the green tea leaves from the used stamen.
– This ensures that only the green tea leaves, now infused with the lotus flavor, remain for brewing.
## Famous places for delicious lotus tea in Vietnam
### Hanoi
The lotus tea of Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is considered to be one of the finest in this country. This is due in part to the unique qualities of the lotus flowers grown in West Lake ( Vietnamese: Hồ Tây), which is located northwest of the city center. The lotus flowers grown in West Lake are known for their intense fragrance.
### Hue
Hue, Vietnam’s former imperial capital, boasts a reputation for exquisite lotus tea. This prized beverage was a popular choice during the [Nguyen Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_dynasty), enjoyed by the royal court. To ensure its perfection, only the finest lotus flowers were handpicked and meticulously prepared by the most skilled artisans.
Today, the people of Hue continue to preserve this ancient tradition, crafting lotus tea with the same dedication and care. The result is a truly exceptional tea that embodies the rich history and cultural heritage of Vietnam.

Through these sections, readers will gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of Vietnamese coffee, enabling them to explore its rich flavors and textures in their own homes.
## History and origins of Vietnamese coffee
Coffee was first introduced to Vietnam by the French in 1857, which they brought from **[Martinique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique)** and [**French Guiana**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana) in Latin America due to the similar tropical climate and soil conditions.
Initially, they experimented with growing Arabica coffee in the **[northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Vietnam)** and **[central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vietnam)** regions of Vietnam. The harvested beans were then processed and sold under the brand Arabica du Tonkin and imported back to France.
In 1925, after conducting extensive surveys of Vietnam’s climate and soil, the French decided to try growing coffee in the [**Central Highlands**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Highlands_\(Vietnam\)). They found that the **[Lang Biang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%C3%A0_L%E1%BA%A1t_Plateau)** Plateau was ideal for Arabica, while regions like **[Dak Lak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BA%AFk_L%E1%BA%AFk_province)** were better suited for Robusta.
Today, Vietnam is the **[second-largest](https://vietnam.vn/en/kim-ngach-xuat-khau-ca-phe-cua-viet-nam-nam-2023-cao-ky-luc-dat-424-ty-usd/)** coffee exporter in the world, even though it ranks sixth globally in terms of coffee-growing area.
Arabica and Robusta coffee differ in caffeine content and growing conditions. Arabica has 1.12 – 1.7% caffeine and grows best at 59 – 77°F (15 – 25°C) in high altitudes of 900 – 2000 meters. Robusta, with 2 – 2.7% caffeine, thrives in warmer temperatures of 68 – 86°F (20 – 30°C) at lower altitudes of 0 – 900 meters.
## Vietnam’s renowned coffee-growing regions
### Central Highlands
The Central Highlands of Vietnam are perfect for coffee cultivation. With a tropical, humid climate, an elevation of around 500-600 meters, and over 2 million hectares of rich basalt soil, this region is ideal for growing robusta coffee, contributing to 95% of Vietnam’s coffee production. Additionally, certain areas in **[Lam Dong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A2m_%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng_province)** province, located at elevations above 1500 meters with cooler climates, are perfect for cultivating high-quality Arabica coffee.
### Khe Sanh
In central Vietnam, there’s a place called [**Khe Sanh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khe_Sanh#:~:text=Khe%20Sanh%20is%20the%20district,km%20west%20of%20%C4%90%C3%B4ng%20H%C3%A0.&text=During%20the%20Vietnam%20War%2C%20the,of%20the%20war%20are%20exhibited.) in **[Quang Tri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_Tr%E1%BB%8B_province)** province. This region is characterized by its hilly terrain, fertile soil, and cool climate year-round, making it perfect for coffee cultivation. The French introduced coffee here in the early 20th century. Interestingly, Arabica coffee in Khe Sanh is grown at an elevation of just 600 meters above sea level, yet it boasts a unique flavor.
### Northwest (Vietnam)
The **[Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_\(Vietnam\))** region of Vietnam, mainly the provinces of **[Son La](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C6%A1n_La_province)** and **[Dien Bien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90i%E1%BB%87n_Bi%C3%AAn_province)** , offers the perfect soil and climate for growing Arabica coffee. This area is characterized by its impressive mountain ranges, with Arabica coffee thriving at elevations between 900 and 1200 meters. The Arabica plants here grow very well, producing high-quality beans. Son La is the second largest Arabica coffee-growing province in Vietnam, right after Lam Dong.
## Popular Vietnamese coffee varieties
### Ca phe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk)
**[Vietnamese iced coffee](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-iced-coffee/)** , or ca phe sua da, is a tasty drink with a strong flavor and a smooth, slightly sweet taste from the condensed milk. It’s made using a small metal drip filter called a “phin.” To make it, Vietnamese people put the coffee grounds in the phin, pour hot water over them, and let the coffee drip slowly into a glass below.
Once the coffee has finished dripping, they use a spoon to stir and mix the coffee with the condensed milk thoroughly. This method makes a strong, aromatic coffee that mixes well with the sweetness of the condensed milk, making it a great treat, especially on a hot day.
### Ca phe den (black coffee)
The way to make this coffee is like making Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk, but without the milk. Instead, a little sugar is added. This lets people enjoy the pure, strong flavor of the coffee. Without the milk, the true taste of the coffee stands out, making it perfect for those who love a rich coffee flavor.
### Ca phe muoi (salted coffee)
Salted coffee has emerged as a beloved trend in Vietnam in recent years. This unique beverage combines condensed milk, coffee, and a touch of salted cream. The flavor profile is a perfect blend of sweetness from the milk, the bitterness of coffee, and a subtle salty undertone. It’s a refreshing and satisfying drink that offers a harmonious balance of flavors.
### Ca phe trung (egg coffee)
Egg coffee is a unique beverage originating from the capital city of Hanoi, Vietnam. It includes fresh egg yolks, sugar, condensed milk, and coffee. To make egg coffee, Vietnamese people whip the egg yolks with condensed milk and sugar until they form a thick, creamy foam. This mixture is then poured over brewed coffee made using a phin filter.
Egg coffee originated in Hanoi, Vietnam in the 1940s, created by Mr. Nguyen Van Giang. While working as a bartender at a hotel, he came up with the idea of using eggs to make coffee due to a shortage of milk.
### Bac Xiu
Bac Xiu, which translates to “white coffee,” is a lighter and creamier variation of the traditional Vietnamese iced coffee. It contains a higher ratio of milk to coffee, using fresh and condensed milk, giving it a smoother and more delicate flavor profile. This coffee variant is especially popular for its gentle coffee aroma.
## Unique characteristics of Vietnamese coffee
Vietnamese coffee is renowned for its robust and intense flavor profile. This distinctive taste is attributed to several factors.
### **Robusta beans**
Vietnam is the second-largest coffee exporter in the world, primarily growing robusta beans, while arabica is more popular globally. Robusta beans have a higher caffeine content (2 – 2.7%) than arabica (1.12 – 1.7%), resulting in a more bitter taste (the higher caffeine content contributes to the increased bitterness). Additionally, robusta beans contain 60% less fats and sugars than arabica beans, further influencing their flavor profile.
### Over-roasting
Local Vietnamese coffee producers often over-roast the beans, which adds to Vietnamese coffee’s distinctive flavor and aroma.
### Traditional Vietnamese Phin filter
Additionally, the traditional Vietnamese phin filter is used for brewing. This method takes longer, allowing more of the coffee’s active compounds to be extracted, resulting in a stronger, more robust cup.
## Health benefits of coffee
### Energizing benefits
Coffee is more than just a morning drink; it’s a great way to wake up and feel energized. The secret ingredient is **[caffeine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30137774/)** , which stimulates the brain and nervous system. Caffeine works by blocking [**adenosine**](https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/caffeine/), a chemical that makes you feel sleepy and relaxed. When adenosine is blocked, you stay alert and less tired.
### Coffee consumption may lower type 2 diabetes risk
Diabetes is a widespread global health concern, with predictions indicating that by 2030, 552 million people worldwide will be affected by this condition. However, there is promising evidence suggesting that coffee consumption may help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Studies have shown a link between moderate coffee intake and lower disease incidence. For more detailed information on these studies, you can find them [[**here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6003581/)]
### Enhance heart health
Studies indicate that regularly consuming coffee, especially **[3-5 cups](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29276945/)** per day, is associated with a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and lower mortality rates among healthy individuals.
### Support brain health
Regular intake of coffee has been associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as [**Parkinson’s**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7353179/) and **[Alzheimer’s](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26944757/)**. Studies suggest that caffeine can lower the risk of developing dementia and cognitive decline.
## Cultural significance
In Vietnam, coffee is more than just a drink; it’s a lifestyle deeply rooted in the culture. Introduced by French missionaries in the 19th century, coffee quickly became a local favorite. It evolved from its colonial roots to symbolize Vietnamese creativity and identity. Today, Vietnam is the world’s second-largest coffee exporter, mainly producing robusta beans. These beans are known for their strong flavor, often sweetened with condensed milk to balance their natural bitterness.
Vietnamese coffee culture is known for its unique preparation and consumption practices. The traditional phin filter, a single-cup drip method, highlights this uniqueness and promotes a leisurely pace of life. Locals often enjoy their coffee slowly, reflecting the societal value placed on savoring moments. This is a stark contrast to the fast-paced coffee culture of the West.
The social aspect of coffee in Vietnam is equally significant. Coffee shops and street stalls are not just places to drink coffee; they are venues where people gather to catch up on news and enjoy each other’s company at any time of the day. This communal aspect is a cornerstone of Vietnamese daily life, making coffee shops central to social interactions in both urban and rural areas.
Moreover, places like Cafe Giang have survived changes in location and succeeded by keeping their traditional recipes that both locals and tourists love. The cafe’s famous egg coffee, made with robusta coffee, condensed milk, and egg yolk, shows the creative spirit of Vietnam’s coffee culture.
## Popular brands and cafés
### The best Vietnamese coffee brands
**[Trung Nguyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trung_Nguy%C3%AAn)** has played a pivotal role in popularizing Vietnamese coffee both domestically and internationally since its inception in 1996.

**[Vinacafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinacafe)** stands out for its commitment to high-quality coffee, focusing on traditional roasting methods and locally sourced beans. This brand is particularly noted for its instant coffee products, which have contributed significantly to Vietnam’s coffee exports.
King Coffee, founded by [**Le Hoang Diep Thao**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Hoang_Diep_Thao), has expanded its presence beyond Vietnam, offering a range of coffee products that cater to global tastes while maintaining a focus on quality and innovation. This brand’s growth reflects its ambition to share Vietnamese coffee culture worldwide.
### Famous coffee shops in Vietnam

## How to brew Vietnamese coffee at home
To brew authentic Vietnamese coffee at home, one must gather the necessary equipment and ingredients, which include a Vietnamese Phin filter, ground coffee beans, and optionally, sweetened condensed milk. The Phin filter, a crucial tool, consists of three parts: the body, the press or filter disk, and the lid, designed to facilitate a slow drip that enhances the coffee’s flavor.
### Step-by-step brewing process
  * **Prepare the equipment** : Start by assembling your Phin filter and a heatproof glass or mug. If using sweetened condensed milk, spoon the desired amount into the cup before beginning the brewing process.


  * **Boil water** : Heat water to a temperature between 195°-205°F. This specific range is crucial as it is ideal for extracting the full flavor from the coffee without scalding it.


  * **Preheat the phin and cup** : Pour a small amount of the boiled water through the Phin to preheat the filter and the cup. This step ensures the coffee brews at a consistent temperature.


  * **Add coffee grounds** : Place one heaping tablespoon of fine Vietnamese coffee grounds into the Phin. Use the filter press to lightly tamp down the grounds, preparing them for brewing.


  * **Brew the coffee** : Continue to pour hot water into the Phin until it reaches the top. Cover with the lid and allow the coffee to drip slowly through the filter. This process should take about [3-5 minutes](https://iamafoodblog.com/vietnamese-coffee/), resulting in a rich and concentrated brew.


  * **Final touches** : Once the brewing is complete, remove the Phin and stir the coffee. For a traditional iced version, pour the brew over ice, or add more hot water for a milder drink.


### Tips for optimal flavor
  * **Do Not Over-Compress the Coffee** : When adding coffee to the filter, avoid shaking or compressing it excessively. This can clog the filter and hinder the drip process, affecting the overall flavor and brewing time.


  * **Adjust Condensed Milk to Taste** : The amount of sweetened condensed milk can vary depending on personal preference, ranging from one tablespoon for regular coffee to three tablespoons for a very sweet taste.


By following these steps and tips, one can enjoy a delightful cup of Vietnamese coffee, rich in flavor and tradition, right at home.
## Traditional Vietnamese breakfasts and coffee pairings
In Vietnam, it’s common to start the morning with a breakfast that includes dishes like Pho and Banh Mi. After enjoying these flavorful and satisfying meals, many Vietnamese people then indulge in a cup of robust Vietnamese coffee.
This routine highlights the cultural significance of balancing the rich flavors of a traditional breakfast with the strong, aromatic notes of Vietnamese coffee, making for a complete and enjoyable morning experience.

_You might be curious to know what types of plants are commonly grown in Vietnamese households. In our country, Vietnam, especially in rural areas, every family has a garden—a place where the homeowners cultivate plants to make their living space greener. Below, we will introduce to you some of the commonly grown plants in Vietnam._
## **Bamboo**
Vietnam has a hot and humid climate that’s perfect for [bamboo ](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-bamboo/)to grow fast. Bamboo is a big kind of grass, and it’s the biggest one in the world. You can find a lot of bamboo all over Vietnam.
People in Vietnam really like bamboo and use it for different things. A long time ago, they planted bamboo around their gardens to keep the soil safe and stop it from washing away. This is important because Vietnam often has strong storms. Bamboo helps to reduce the wind’s power and protects against damage from these storms.
Besides protecting, people in Vietnam use bamboo for many everyday things. They build houses and bridges with bamboo, and they also make useful kitchen tools like chopsticks and baskets from it.
In the eyes of the Vietnamese, bamboo symbolizes unity and represents the vigorous life that rises resiliently from adversity.
Bamboo is the fastest-growing plant in the world. Some types can grow an incredible three feet in just a single day!
## **Banana tree**
Bananas are a familiar and easy-to-grow plant in Vietnam. They require minimal care, and you don’t need to fertilize or water them much for normal growth. Vietnamese people utilize various parts of the banana plant for different purposes:
Bananas carry significant importance among the Vietnamese, often being a crucial fruit placed on ancestral altars during festive occasions.
Banana blossoms find use in dishes, whether mixed, stir-fried, or consumed raw.
Banana leaves serve as wrappers for [Chung cakes](https://vivavn.com/chung-cake/), a renowned traditional Vietnamese dish commonly made during celebrations.
The trunk of the banana tree becomes a source of food for pigs, chickens, and ducks.
## **Coconut tree**
[The coconut tree](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coconut/) is a characteristic tree in Vietnam, and you can see these trees all over the country. This resilient and economically valuable plant is easy to grow, and different parts of the coconut can be made into yummy dishes.
Coconut water is a tasty and nutritious drink loved by the Vietnamese, especially when it’s hot. It’s also used in many Vietnamese dishes. Did you know that coconut jelly, a yummy Vietnamese treat, is made from coconut water?
Coconut meat can be used to make delicious things like candied coconut ribbons, [baked coconut cracker](https://vivavn.com/topcoco-baked-coconut-cracker/), and coconut candy.
Coconut shells are used as bowls and in making traditional crafts. Some traditional Vietnamese musical instruments are even made from coconut shells.
## ****Areca Catechu****
In Vietnam, people like to plant areca catechu in front of their homes because they believe it symbolizes peace and positivity. They also think that having these palms in front of the house can protect them from bad things, bringing good luck and prosperity to the family.
The areca nut is the fruit of the areca catechu. It plays a significant role in various traditional ceremonies among the Vietnamese, including engagements, weddings, funerals, and more. In the past, there was a custom of consuming areca nuts with betel leaves, considered a means to initiate conversations and create a more comfortable atmosphere.
Areca nuts are also regarded as symbols of love, harmony, and commitment in Vietnamese married life. This is why the betel and areca nut tray is an indispensable element in every wedding. If you have the opportunity to witness a Vietnamese wedding, you’ll observe that the first exchange during the ceremony involves a betel and areca nut tray between the two families.

### The other ingredients
In addition to sourcing their main ingredient, coconuts, from Tam Quan, Binh Dinh province, Top Coco partners with farmers in Hoa Vang district, Da Nang city to cultivate and harvest peanuts and sesame seeds, creating unique baked coconut cracker products.

These crackers boast a harmonious blend of coconut meat and Vietnamese coconut nectar, without any added sugar.
## A taste of Vietnam: the allure of coconut 
Coconuts are an important ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine and culture. They are found in almost every region of the country but are especially abundant in the southern part of Vietnam.
Coconut meat is used to make many dishes, such as coconut sticky rice, candied coconut ribbons, and coconut candy. Coconut water is also an essential ingredient in many Vietnamese dishes, including caramelized pork and eggs.
In southern Vietnam, during [the Lunar New Year](https://vivavn.com/what-is-tet/), coconuts are always included in the tray of five [fruits](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/) that are offered to ancestors on the altar. This is a symbol of good luck and prosperity for the coming year.
## How Top Coco baked coconut crackers are made
### Step 1: Harvesting the coconuts
The coconuts are harvested in Tam Quan, a region in Binh Dinh province that is known for its high-quality coconuts. After harvesting, the coconuts are husked and the coconut meat is carefully extracted. The coconut meat is then transported to the factory in Da Nang city.
### Step 2: Mixing the ingredients
The fresh coconut meat is mixed with other ingredients, such as mung beans, sesame seeds, peanuts, rice flour, and glutinous rice flour. The specific ingredients vary depending on the product line. Top Coco currently offers four product lines: traditional flavor, sesame flavor, peanut flavor, and mung bean flavor.
### Step 3: Rolling out the dough
The dough is rolled out into thin sheets.
### Step 4: Baking the crackers
The crackers are baked in an oven until they are golden brown and crispy.
### Step 5: Packaging the crackers
The crackers are cooled and then packaged in individual bags.
The Top Coco Coconut Cracker Production Process
## The Top Coco story: a journey of passion and tradition
Mai Thi Y Nhi (left) and Nguyen Van Tan (right), the co-founders of the Top Coco brand.
Mai Thi Y Nhi grew up surrounded by coconut palms in Tam Quan, Vietnam. Everywhere she looked, coconuts seemed to be a part of life – used in delicious dishes, woven into everyday crafts. This deep connection with the humble coconut sparked a dream in Nhi: to create healthy snacks that showcased the goodness of her hometown’s bounty.
Nhi wasn’t just passionate about the coconut’s delicious potential; she also saw a chance to give back to the local farmers. Despite the abundance of coconuts, many growers struggled to make a decent living. This inspired Nhi’s vision: to create successful products using the region’s coconuts and, in turn, support the local community.
After moving to Da Nang City with her husband (Nguyen Van Tan), they opened a small bakery. Since 2016, the couple spent a year researching and developing the first recipe for baked coconut crackers.
However, when they first introduced their product to the market, they faced numerous challenges: consumers were indifferent to the new product, they lacked capital, and persuading retail stores and supermarkets to carry their product was difficult.
Undeterred, Nhi and her husband displayed unwavering determination. They tirelessly approached retailers, showcasing the product’s quality and deliciousness to potential customers. They continuously refined their production process, ensuring the crackers were healthy and consistently tasty.
Their hard work paid off. Customers started embracing Top Coco’s unique flavor and healthy approach. Then came a breakthrough – their first export order, all the way from Japan! It was then that they realized that their startup could survive.
Top Coco baked coconut crackers have been certified as a 4-star [OCOP](https://vivavn.com/what-is-ocop-vietnam/) product by Da Nang City, making them a specialty of the city. The crackers are exported to markets such as Japan, Korea, the US, China, Laos, Mongolia, France, and many more.

## Tips for visiting Linh Ung Pagoda Da Nang
### **Weather tips**
**On sunny days:**
Bring a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen to protect yourself from the heat. The open spaces around the pagoda can get quite sunny, so staying hydrated is important. You can bring your own water or grab a drink from one of the refreshment stands inside the pagoda grounds.
**On rainy days:**
Pack a lightweight raincoat or umbrella to stay dry, as the area can get slippery. Comfortable, non-slip shoes are a must, especially if you plan to explore the gardens and walkways.
### **Linh Ung Pagoda dress code**
**Dress modestly:**
Since the pagoda is a sacred site, it’s respectful to wear modest clothing. Lightweight, breathable fabrics are a great choice for staying comfortable.
**Comfortable shoes:**
When you’re visiting Linh Ung Pagoda, it’s a good idea to wear shoes that are easy to slip off, since you’ll need to take them off when entering the more sacred areas, like the main hall. And with all the walking around, make sure to choose comfortable, non-slip shoes. Slip-on shoes or sandals with straps are perfect for both convenience and comfort.
### **Transportation tips**
You can use an automatic scooter to get to the pagoda, but note that automatic scooters aren’t allowed to access some other attractions on Son Tra Peninsula, like the Thousand-Year-Old Banyan Tree or [Ban Co Peak](https://vivavn.com/ban-co-peak/). If you plan to visit these places after the pagoda, it’s better to choose a semi-automatic scooter instead.
Also, make sure to check your fuel tank, as there are no gas stations on the peninsula. It’s a good idea to inspect your tires to ensure they are properly inflated, as there are no air pumps available. Don’t forget to check the brakes as well, since the roads include some steep areas.
This sign is located at the foot of Son Tra Mountain and indicates that automatic scooters are prohibited 9 kilometers ahead. This means you can still use an automatic scooter to reach Linh Ung Pagoda, which is only 3 kilometers from the foot of the mountain, as well as at places like Rock Beach and Ghenh Bang Beach. However, certain spots, such as the Ancient Banyan Tree (Cay Da Ngan nam) and Mui Nghe (Nghe Cape), do not allow automatic scooters.
### **Cash tips**
It’s a good idea to bring some Vietnamese cash with you. At Linh Ung Pagoda, parking is free, but for other attractions on Son Tra Peninsula, you’ll need to pay for parking. Also, if you plan to buy drinks or snacks, some shops may not accept card payments, so having cash on hand can be useful.
### **Monkey spotting tips**
Monkeys can appear in the Linh Ung Pagoda area, but the most common spots to see them are along the coconut trees about 5km away from the pagoda and near the entrance of the InterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort, which is around 8km from the pagoda.
### **Monkey alert**
Be cautious around the monkeys. They are known to beg for food and can sometimes steal your belongings. Keep your items secure and avoid feeding them to prevent any unwanted situations.
The monkeys at Ghenh Bang are notorious for grabbing food, keys, or phones. Always stay alert when you’re in this area to avoid any issues.

Frequently asked questions
## What is Vietnamese passion fruit?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** chanh day/ chanh leo
**Shape and appearance:** round or oval; smooth purple skin when ripe, sometimes with natural white specks.
**Flavor profile:** tart and citrusy with a hint of sweetness; aromatic and refreshing.
**How to enjoy it:** in Vietnam, passion fruit is enjoyed fresh, as juice, in desserts, or made into soft-dried fruit snacks.
### What does a Vietnamese passion fruit look like?
Vietnamese passion fruit can be either round or oval in shape, and its appearance might surprise you if you’ve never seen one before. Most varieties grown in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam) have deep purple skin when ripe, sometimes with natural white specks on the surface — that’s completely normal.
Typically, the fruits measure around 4 to 8 centimeters (about 1.5 to 3.1 inches) in diameter. When freshly ripe, the skin is smooth and glossy. As the fruit becomes sweeter and more aromatic, the skin begins to wrinkle, which is actually a good sign.

_Typical size of ripe Vietnamese passion fruit — about 5 cm in diameter._
_From left to right: unripe green passion fruit, ripe purple fruit with smooth skin, and fully ripe fruit with wrinkled skin._
Take a look at the photo above to see the three common stages of ripeness:
**Unripe** : Green skin with white specks. The fruit is still firm and not ready to eat—pulp inside is too sour and underdeveloped.
**Ripe** : Smooth purple skin. This is the standard ripe stage, and the fruit is ready to eat with a sweet-tart flavor that’s refreshing and balanced.
**Fully ripe** : Wrinkled purple skin with softer pulp inside. At this stage, the flavor is sweeter, more aromatic, and less tangy—many people actually prefer eating passion fruit when it looks a little wrinkled like this.
**Tip:** For eating fresh, pick a passion fruit that feels heavy for its size and has slightly wrinkled skin—it’s usually sweeter and more flavorful.

### What’s inside a Vietnamese passion fruit?
When you cut open a Vietnamese passion fruit, you’ll find three distinct layers. The thick outer skin is firm and often a deep purple color when ripe. Just beneath the skin is a soft, spongy white layer called the pith. While it’s not typically eaten, this layer helps protect the fruit’s flavorful center.
At the core is the golden pulp — a juicy, jelly-like filling packed with edible black seeds. This pulp is where all the flavor lives: sweet, tart, aromatic, and tropical. The seeds add a crunchy texture and are safe (and common) to eat along with the pulp.

### What does Vietnamese passion fruit taste like?
Vietnamese passion fruit has a bright, tropical flavor with a mix of tartness and subtle sweetness. When freshly cut, the first thing you’ll notice is its signature tang — a sharp, citrusy sourness that’s refreshing rather than overpowering.
As the fruit ripens, a natural sweetness begins to emerge, softening the acidity and creating a more rounded, balanced flavor.

**Tip:** Wrinkled skin usually means the passion fruit is ripe, fragrant, and sweeter — many Vietnamese people prefer it this way.
Just avoid any fruit with mold, or a sour smell — that’s a sign it’s gone bad.
## How to eat Vietnamese passion fruit
Vietnamese passion fruit is easy to enjoy, whether you’re eating it fresh or adding it to your favorite recipes. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to help you get the most out of this tropical fruit, complete with real photos.
### Step 1: Wash the fruit
Before cutting, rinse the passion fruit under cool water to remove any dirt or debris. The outer skin isn’t eaten, but keeping things clean is always a good start.
### Step 2: Slice it in half
Use a sharp knife to slice it in half. The outer skin is thick but cuts easily with a bit of pressure.
### **Step 3: Reveal the golden pulp**
Once cut open, you’ll see the bright yellow-orange pulp filled with small black seeds. This is the edible part of the fruit — juicy, aromatic, and full of flavor.
### **Step 4: Scoop out the pulp**
Grab a spoon and scoop the pulp straight from the shell. You can eat it fresh or use it to make drinks and desserts.
### **Step 5: Serve or store**
Scoop the pulp into a glass cup if you’re using it in smoothies or drinks. You can enjoy it right away or refrigerate it for later use.
## Popular ways to enjoy Vietnamese passion fruit
### **Passion fruit juice**
In Vietnam, passion fruit juice is a simple, well-loved drink, especially during the hot summer months. It’s easy to make and packed with natural flavor.
To prepare it, you just cut open a ripe passion fruit, scoop the pulp into a glass, add some cool water, and stir in a bit of sugar or honey to taste. Toss in a handful of ice cubes, and that’s it — you’ve got a refreshing, tangy-sweet drink that’s both hydrating and full of tropical aroma.

### **Soft-dried Vietnamese passion fruit**
Ripe passion fruit is slowly dried to reduce its sourness and bring out a mellow sweetness. Its natural aroma and flavor are preserved, resulting in a chewy snack with a bright, balanced taste.
Soft-dried passion fruit is a popular Vietnamese treat — slightly sweet, tangy, and full of tropical flavor. It’s a great option for anyone who enjoys natural fruit snacks and one of the most distinctive choices among Vietnamese dried fruits.

### **Fresh passion fruit with honey**
Another easy way to enjoy Vietnamese passion fruit is to eat it straight from the shell, with a little honey added right inside. Just cut the fruit in half, drizzle a spoonful of honey over the pulp, and scoop it out with a spoon. You can also scoop the pulp into a glass, stir in honey to taste, and enjoy it that way.
This method brings out a softer sweetness while keeping the fruit’s bright, tropical flavor. No prep needed — just fresh, simple, and satisfying.

## Frequently asked questions about Vietnamese passion fruit
### What does Vietnamese passion fruit taste like?
The taste is bright, tangy, and tropical, with a citrus-like tartness that becomes softer and sweeter as the fruit ripens. When combined with honey or sugar, it transforms into a balanced, refreshing treat.
### How do you know when Vietnamese passion fruit is ripe?
A ripe Vietnamese passion fruit will have deep purple skin that’s either smooth or slightly wrinkled. The more wrinkled it is, the sweeter and more aromatic the pulp tends to be.
### Can you eat Vietnamese passion fruit seeds?
Yes, the black seeds inside the pulp are generally considered edible. Some people eat them along with the juicy pulp, as they add a bit of texture. Others prefer to strain the seeds out and use just the liquid and pulp. If you have any concerns or digestive sensitivities, it’s a good idea to check with your doctor first.

_Pho Trach village is a small village located about 50 kilometers north of Hue city in Vietnam. The village is famous for weaving[ eco-friendly products](https://vivavn.com/vietnam-eco-friendly-products/) from grey sedge (cỏ bàng) that grows in the local wetlands. Their products are known for their durability and beauty, and they are popular souvenirs for tourists visiting Vietnam._
## Unveiling the history of Pho Trach’s sedge weaving
Pho Trach village was founded in the mid-1400s. For centuries, the villagers have made a living by farming [rice](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-organic-rice/). During the off-season, they earn additional income by weaving products from grey sedge.
Pho Trach Village is located in a coastal plain area. The area has low-lying areas that are flooded year-round, which makes it a good place for grey sedge grass to grow. In the past, the villagers noticed that wild grey sedge grass could be used to weave beautiful and durable sleeping mats. They started planting sedge grass on the edges of their rice fields. They harvested it once a year, dried it, and stored it carefully so they could use it throughout the year.
In Pho Trach village, the art of sedge mat weaving is passed down from generation to generation. Parents teach their children how to weave sedge, and even women who marry into the village learn how to weave mats.
Beyond their traditional craft of weaving mats for sale, the villagers of Pho Trach have channeled their skills and creativity into a variety of new products. Now they offer fashionable items like bags, hats, and caps, as well as beautiful home decor pieces.

## What is Lemon basil?
Lemon basil (_Ocimum × africanum_), also known as hoary basil, Thai lemon basil, or “e” in Vietnamese, is a fragrant herb with a fresh, citrusy aroma reminiscent of lemongrass and lemon zest. Native to tropical Asia and northeastern Africa, this hybrid of sweet basil and [American basil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocimum_americanum) is loved for its light, soothing flavor and lemony scent.
In Vietnam, lemon basil is often mixed with other aromatic herbs in fresh herb platters (_rau song_), served alongside chicken hotpot, or steamed with seafood like shrimp or clams to add a refreshing, citrusy aroma.

## What is Thai basil?
Thai basil (Ocimum basilicum var. thyrsiflora), also known as “hung que” in Vietnamese, is a fragrant herb native to Southeast Asia and a member of the mint family. It has a bold, anise-like aroma with subtle hints of licorice. Thai basil is commonly featured in dishes such as _pho_(Vietnam’s iconic noodle soup), fresh herb platters (_rau song_), and various stir-fried dishes.

## **What Lemon basil and Thai basil have in common**
While lemon basil and Thai basil have differences in flavor and appearance, they do share several important traits. Both belong to the mint family (Lamiaceae), thrive in loose, well-draining soil, and love full sun—ideally around six hours per day. With proper care, both can be harvested within 30 to 40 days of planting, making them fast-growing herbs commonly found in Vietnamese home gardens.
_In this image, you can see the kind of loose, well-drained soil that helps lemon basil and Thai basil grow strong and healthy._
## **Key differences between Lemon basil and Thai basil**
### Differences in flowers, stems, and leaves
#### How their flowers look different
Both lemon basil and Thai basil produce flowers along long, slender spikes that grow from the top of the plant. The overall structure is similar, but lemon basil blooms are typically pure white, giving them a clean, delicate look. In contrast, Thai basil flowers are white with a soft purple hue at the base of each petal.

### Flavor and aroma comparison
Lemon basil has a light, citrusy aroma that’s refreshing and soothing, often compared to fresh lemongrass or lemon zest. Its flavor is mild, with a delicate sweetness and a hint of tangy sourness, followed by a cool, minty warmth and subtle peppery notes that linger gently on the tongue.
In contrast, Thai basil offers a bolder, more complex aroma, defined by its sweet, anise-like scent with hints of licorice. The flavor is stronger and slightly spicy, with a warm depth that lingers on the palate.
## Ways Lemon basil and Thai basil are used in Vietnamese dishes
Both lemon basil and Thai basil are often enjoyed as part of a fresh herb platter, known in Vietnam as _rau song_. This platter often includes a mix of [aromatic herbs](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/) like fish mint, lettuce, [perilla](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-perilla/), and various types of basil. It’s typically served alongside rich dishes, like meats, fried foods, or grilled items, to add freshness, balance the flavors, and cut through the heaviness.
Besides being part of herb platters, both are also used in different Vietnamese dishes to bring out their natural aroma.
### Lemon basil in Vietnamese cuisine
Lemon basil is often added to chicken hotpot or used to steam chicken. In some coastal areas, it’s also used to steam shrimp or clams, adding a fresh, herbal fragrance to the seafood.
Its seeds are also popular in Vietnam for making a refreshing drink—soaked in a sweet ginger syrup, the seeds develop a soft, jelly-like coating that’s perfect for cooling off on hot days.
_This image shows a light and cooling Vietnamese drink made with lemon basil seeds in ginger syrup._
### Thai basil in Vietnamese cuisine
Thai basil is perhaps best known as the go-to herb served with _Vietnamese pho_. If you’ve ever eaten _pho_ in Vietnam, you’ve likely seen a plate of Thai basil on the side, ready to be added to your bowl of _pho_. It’s also used as a garnish or added near the end of cooking in stir-fries and curries to bring out its sweet, spicy, anise-like flavor.

## What is lemongrass?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** sa
**Shape and appearance:** tall, grass-like plant with long, slender green stalks and a bulbous base
**Flavor profile:** citrusy, lemony, and slightly peppery with a fresh, bright aroma.
**How to enjoy it:** in Vietnam, lemongrass is used to flavor soups, stir-fries, and herbal teas.
Lemongrass is a tropical herb widely grown and used across Southeast Asia, especially in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam). It grows in clusters, with tall, slender stalks reaching about 1 to 1.5 meters high. Each plant has two main parts: the lower stalk and the upper leafy portion.
In Vietnamese cooking, the lower stalk is most commonly used. Before using, the tough outer layers are peeled away to reveal the soft inner core, which is then finely chopped or bruised to release its bright, citrusy aroma.
This part is not only essential in savory dishes like soups and stir-fries but is also commonly simmered to make soothing herbal teas. The long green leaves can also be used in teas or infusions, though they’re less frequently included in cooking.

_Close-up of lemongrass stalks near the base—this is the part most commonly used in Vietnamese cooking_
_Lemongrass leaves—less common in cooking._
## Peeling and cutting lemongrass: A quick how-to
To use lemongrass in cooking, start by giving the stalks a good rinse under water. Then trim off the root end and the top, keeping only the lower 3 to 4 inches (8 to 10 cm) of the stalk—the pale, firm section near the base, where the flavor is most concentrated. Peel away the tough outer layers to reveal the tender core inside.
For soups and stews, lemongrass is often bruised and added whole or in large sections to infuse flavor, then removed before serving. For stir-fries or marinades, it’s usually minced finely so it blends well with other ingredients.

_**Step 2:** Peel away the tough outer layers to get to the soft, fragrant core._
_**Step 3:** Sliced or bruised—two classic ways to prep lemongrass for Vietnamese dishes._
## Popular Vietnamese dishes with lemongrass
### Lemongrass tea (tra sa)
In Vietnam, lemongrass isn’t just for savory dishes—it also finds its way into warm, comforting drinks. One simple and beloved example is lemongrass tea, a type of **herbal tea** enjoyed for both its flavor and soothing properties. It’s made by gently simmering fresh lemongrass stalks, then adding honey and a bit of lemon juice. The result is a light, fragrant tea with a subtle citrus aroma and a naturally sweet, soothing flavor. Many people enjoy it as a way to unwind after a long day, and it’s often served at home rather than in cafés.

### Lemongrass chicken stir-fry (ga kho sa)
Another popular way lemongrass is used in Vietnam is in lemongrass chicken stir-fry. The chicken is chopped into bite-sized pieces, then marinated with finely chopped lemongrass and a mix of traditional Vietnamese spices. After soaking up all the flavors, it’s stir-fried over high heat until the chicken is tender and aromatic. The dish is bold, slightly spicy, and full of rich, savory notes—perfect for serving with a bowl of warm rice

### Hue beef noodle soup (bun bo Hue)
One of Vietnam’s most iconic dishes, _bun bo Hue_ is all about its bold, flavorful broth. The soup base is simmered with beef bones, pork bones, fermented shrimp paste, lemongrass, and a blend of traditional Vietnamese spices like chili, garlic, shallots, and [fish sauce](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fish-sauce/). The lemongrass is bruised and slow-simmered, giving the broth its signature citrusy aroma that sets it apart from other noodle soups. The result is a rich, spicy, and deeply aromatic dish that’s both comforting and full of character.

## Growing and harvesting lemongrass in Vietnam
In Vietnam, lemongrass is something almost every rural household grows. In the countryside, you’ll often see clumps of lemongrass growing in backyard gardens. It’s low-maintenance and thrives in the warm, humid climate.
The most common way to grow lemongrass is by planting a stalk directly into the soil. Over time, this single stalk multiplies into a dense cluster. Within three to four months, it’s ready to harvest.
Farmers typically use a sharp knife or garden shears to cut the stalks about 3 to 5 centimeters above the ground. This method encourages the plant to regrow, allowing for multiple harvests from the same bush. After harvesting, the upper leafy part is usually trimmed off, and only the firm, fragrant lower stalk is kept, ready to be sold at markets.
At local markets, you’ll often see baskets full of freshly harvested lemongrass, bundled neatly alongside other aromatic herbs and spices.

## Lemongrass in Vietnamese folk medicine
**Note before we begin:**
These traditional uses of lemongrass come from Vietnamese folk medicine, passed down through generations. While they remain popular today and are often part of home remedies, they haven’t been scientifically proven. So consider them cultural insights rather than medical advice.
### Herbal steam remedy for colds
In Vietnamese folk medicine, lemongrass has been included in herbal steam remedies for relieving cold symptoms. A traditional remedy involves boiling lemongrass leaves, [pomelo leaves](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-pomelo/), [perilla (_la tia to_)](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-perilla/), and other herbs to create a pot of herbal steam. The person sits near the pot, making sure it’s placed safely to avoid spills, and covers both themselves and the pot with a large blanket. The enclosed steam helps open pores, promote sweating, and relieve congestion. This simple method, known as _“xông”_ , is still practiced in many rural households.
### Natural hair rinse
In Vietnam, lemongrass leaves are sometimes boiled together with other fragrant herbs like pomelo leaves to create a natural hair rinse. Once the herbal water cools to a warm temperature, it’s used to wash the hair. This traditional remedy is believed to help reduce dandruff, leave the scalp feeling refreshed, and give the hair a light, pleasant scent.
### Lemongrass essential oil
Lemongrass essential oil is cherished not just for its fresh citrus scent but also for its calming and cleansing properties. In Vietnam, it’s commonly used to reduce stress and support better sleep—just a few drops in a diffuser can create a more relaxing, restful space. Thanks to its natural antibacterial properties, it also helps purify the air and eliminate odors, making it a popular choice for home wellness.

## Frequently asked questions about lemongrass
### What part of lemongrass do you actually eat?
The lower stalk is the most commonly used part in cooking. It’s peeled to reveal a tender core that’s chopped or bruised for maximum flavor.
### Is lemongrass spicy?
Not really. It has a citrusy, lemony flavor with a hint of pepper, but it’s more aromatic than spicy. It enhances the dish without overpowering it.
### How do I use fresh lemongrass in cooking?
Peel the tough outer layers, then finely chop or bruise the tender stalk. You can add it directly to soups, marinades, or teas.
### Can you eat lemongrass raw?
You technically can, but it’s fibrous and tough. It’s best used cooked, steeped, or bruised to release its flavor.

## History and cultural significance
In the 17th century, China went through a turbulent time as the Qing dynasty replaced the Ming. Many loyalists of the fallen Ming dynasty refused to submit, and after their failed resistance, some fled with their families across the sea to Southeast Asia. Hoi An became one of the places where they settled.
With permission from the Nguyen Lords of Vietnam, these migrants established the Minh Huong community in Hoi An. They came from five main provinces of southern China—Fujian, Chaozhou, Guangdong, Hainan, and Hakka. Because the Chinese valued community life, each group built its own assembly hall as a place to gather, support each other, and maintain their cultural traditions.
The Fujian Assembly Hall was created for people from [Fujian Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian). It served as both a meeting place for their community and a spiritual center where they could honor their deities and practice their faith far from home.

## Architecture of the Fujian assembly hall
The entire complex stretches about 100 meters in length and 24 meters at its widest point. Arranged along a straight front-to-back layout, it’s divided into four main parts: the main gate, the courtyard, the main hall, and finally the rear hall.
### **The main gate**
The first thing you’ll see as you approach is the red main gate. Above it hangs a traditional plaque with Chinese characters that read ‘Fujian Assembly Hall.’ The gate has three doorways, but only the two side doors are used for daily entry. The center door stays closed most of the year and is only opened on special occasions. In the past, people believed that keeping the main gate shut would prevent bad spirits from entering the hall.

### **The courtyard**
Right past the gate, you’ll step into a small courtyard filled with potted plants and bonsai trees. The space feels calm and welcoming, almost like a pause before you enter the main hall. In both Chinese and Vietnamese architecture, courtyards like this are common—they’re meant to bring a sense of balance and peace to the space.
### **The main hall**
The facade of the main hall looks modest at first glance, with weathered roof tiles that hint at its age. But step inside, and the scene changes—the hall opens up in deep shades of red, giving it a solemn yet striking atmosphere. Right at the entrance stands a long stone table, once used by members of the Fujian community to gather and discuss important matters.

The roof is supported by rows of striking red wooden columns. Hanging from the ceiling are large incense coils, and if you look closely, you’ll notice a small yellow tag attached to each one.
Visitors write down their wishes or prayers on these tags before hanging them with the incense. When the coil finishes burning, the caretakers of the hall collect and burn the tags—an act believed to help send those wishes to the divine.
_The hanging incense coils carry small tags where visitors write down their wishes and prayers_
At the very center stands the altar of Thien Hau, the sea goddess worshipped by the Fujian community. According to legend, she was born in Fujian and was known for her ability to swim and rescue people from shipwrecks. After her death, locals began to worship her as a protector of sailors, praying for her blessing before setting out on dangerous sea journeys.

The walls are decorated with murals showing Ming generals resisting the Qing dynasty and the perilous sea journeys that brought the Fujian settlers here. In addition to these murals, there’s also a model of the boat used by Fujian immigrants, complete with the supplies they carried for life at sea.

### **The rear hall**
If you walk all the way to the back, you’ll find a rear hall. This space is dedicated to six Fujian generals who fought against the Qing dynasty. After their defeat, they brought their families by sea to Hoi An, and today the altar here honors their legacy

### **Learn common keywords**
When searching on Google Maps, try Vietnamese phrases like _“quán phở ngon”_ (good pho restaurants) or _“quán bánh xèo ngon ở Hà Nội”_ (good _banh xeo_ restaurants in Hanoi). Adding the city name helps you find local recommendations quickly.
Most restaurants in Vietnam don’t use English for their names on Google Maps or menus, so searching in Vietnamese ensures more accurate and relevant results.
**Searching in a specific city:**
Use the structure: “ _Quán_ + [Dish Name] + _ở_ + [Location]”.  
For example, to find banh xeo in Hanoi, type: “ _Quán bánh xèo ở Hà Nội_ “.
**Searching for places near you:**
Use the structure: “ _Quán_ + [Dish Name] + _gần đây_ “.  
For example, to find pho near you, type: “ _Quán phở gần đây_ “.”
_**Quán** _= restaurant/shop
**_ở_** = in (used for locations)
**_gần đây_** = near here/nearby
### **Look for English reviews**
While many places have reviews in Vietnamese, prioritize spots with English reviews to see if the flavors match your preferences.
### **Ask locals for recommendations**
Don’t hesitate to ask hotel staff or tour guides for their favorite places. They often know hidden gems.
## FAQs about Vietnamese cuisine for beginners: Top dishes, tips, and more
### What to eat in Vietnam for a first visit?
If you’re visiting Vietnam for the first time, you might wonder: ‘What are the best dishes to try?’ Here’s the answer!
  * **Vietnamese iced coffee (ca phe sua da)** – Strong coffee with sweetened condensed milk and ice.
  * **Vietnamese noodle soup (pho)** – Flavorful broth with rice noodles, herbs, and meat (beef or chicken).
  * **Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi)** – Crispy baguette filled with meats, pickled vegetables, and fresh herbs.
  * **Vietnamese sizzling pancakes (banh xeo)** – Crispy pancakes filled with shrimp, pork, and bean sprouts.
  * **Fresh Vietnamese spring rolls (goi cuon)** – Light rolls with shrimp, pork, herbs, and noodles in rice paper.
  * **Grilled pork with rice noodles (bun cha)** – Grilled pork served with rice noodles, herbs, and a tasty dipping sauce.


### What is the famous soup in Vietnam?
The most famous soup in Vietnam is Pho, a flavorful noodle soup made with beef or chicken, fresh herbs, and a savory broth. Another popular Vietnamese soup is Bun Bo Hue, a spicy beef noodle soup originating from Hue.
### How to ask for vegetarian food in Vietnam
To ask for vegetarian food in Vietnam, you can say:
  * **“Ở đây có món chay không?”** – “Do you have vegetarian food?”


  * **“Tôi ăn chay”** – “I am vegetarian.”


If you’re unsure about the language, you can use a **translation app** like **Google Translate** to help you communicate. Simply type or speak your request in English, and the app will translate it to Vietnamese, making it easier to order vegetarian food.
### What does “chay” mean in Vietnamese?
“Chay” refers to vegetarian or vegan food in Vietnamese. It means no meat, fish, or any animal products, including broth made from meat. Dishes labeled “chay” are made with only vegetables, fruits, and plant-based ingredients. Additionally, fish sauce is not used in “chay” dishes, as it’s made from anchovies. Instead, soy sauce (_xi dau_) is used as a substitute to add flavor.
### **How to Find Vegetarian Restaurants in Vietnam**
To find vegetarian restaurants in Vietnam, look for the word “Chay” on the restaurant’s sign. “Chay” (pronounced: “chai”) means vegetarian in Vietnamese, and if you see it on the sign, the restaurant typically specializes in vegetarian dishes. For example, “Quán Chay” or “Cơm Chay” are restaurants that serve plant-based meals, free from meat and animal products. If you’re unsure, simply ask: “Ở đây có món chay không?” which means “Do you have vegetarian food?”

# Discovering Da Xanh Pomelo: Vietnam’s Finest Citrus Fruit
We’re excited to share some valuable insights about Vietnam’s Da Xanh pomelo
5 min
[](https://vivavn.com/fruit/)
Fruit
[](https://youtu.be/6WcI1E6Mo-U)
_In this article, we’ll explore Da Xanh pomelo, one of the many**[pomelo varieties](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-pomelo/)** found in Vietnam, but widely considered the best. You’ll get to know its unique qualities, its tasty flavor, how it’s grown by Vietnamese farmers, and the ways it’s enjoyed in Vietnam. _
## What is Da Xanh pomelo?
### Shape and color
The Da Xanh pomelo (bưởi Da Xanh) is a round [fruit](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/), typically 13 to 20 cm in diameter, and weighs between 1.2 to 2.5 kg. Its skin stays green or turns slightly yellow when ripe. Inside, the flesh ranges from light pink to red and can be either seedless or have seeds.
The Da Xanh pomelo tree usually grows to about 3 to 5 meters tall. It takes about three years for the tree to bear its first fruit, with peak production happening around the fifth year. Each tree produces 50 to 70 fruits annually, and it takes around 7 to 8 months from flowering to harvest.
### Taste and flavor
The Da Xanh pomelo has a natural sweetness with a Brix level of 9.5–12%, balanced with just a hint of tanginess. Its juicy segments provide a refreshing bite, making it a perfect snack on a hot day. As soon as you cut into a Da Xanh pomelo, a delightful, citrusy aroma fills the air, giving you a sense of calm and refreshment. The fragrance is inviting and soothing, making the experience of enjoying this fruit even more enjoyable.
**Brix Level (°Bx)** measures the sugar content in a liquid as a percentage. One degree Brix equals 1 gram of sugar (specifically sucrose) in 100 grams of liquid. It’s a common way to gauge how sweet things like fruit, juice, wine, and honey are. The higher the Brix level, the sweeter the product.
### How Vietnamese farmers grow Da Xanh pomelo
In **[Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam)** , the Da Xanh pomelo is highly valued and widely cultivated by farmers. However, this fruit doesn’t start producing until at least three years after planting. To make the most of their orchards, many farmers also grow guavas alongside their pomelo trees. Guavas have a much shorter harvest period—starting to bear fruit just nine months after planting. Plus, there’s an added benefit: guava leaves help repel pests that can harm the Da Xanh pomelo trees. This clever combination ensures a productive and thriving orchard.
## How Vietnamese people enjoy Da Xanh pomelo
In Vietnam, Da Xanh pomelo is enjoyed in a couple of delightful ways. Many people simply eat it fresh, savoring its sweet flavor. However, for a unique twist, it’s also common to enjoy Da Xanh pomelo with a sprinkle of salt and chili powder. This combination creates an exciting mix of flavors—sweetness from the pomelo, a hint of tartness, a touch of saltiness from the salt, and a bit of heat from the chili.

Bamboo
## Introduction
Nguyen Van Phuc has dedicated his life to crafting [eco-friendly bamboo](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-bamboo/) furniture. His workshop is located on the outskirts of Dien Ban town, Quang Nam province, Vietnam.
Quang Nam is a coastal province in Central Vietnam, located near the northernmost part of the South Central Coast region. It’s famous for the historic city of Hoi An, a popular tourist destination.
## The unique features of Nguyen Van Phuc’s furniture
The bamboo bases like this make his products unique.
Most bamboo furniture manufacturers throw away the bamboo base and only use the bamboo stem to make their products. What makes Nguyen Van Phuc’s bamboo furniture unique is that he uses the entire bamboo plant, including the base, to create his pieces. This gives his furniture a unique and distinctive look.
“To make bamboo furniture like mine, you need more than just skill. You also need patience and perseverance,” said Mr. Nguyen Van Phuc. “The bamboo we use must have beautiful base. After we dig it up, we have to dry it in the sun for almost a year before we can use it to make furniture.”

**Paragliding landing spot:** Touch down on the beach at the base of Son Tra Mountain.
**Getting to the takeoff point:** Starting from the gathering spot at the base of Son Tra Mountain, your pilot will lead you up to the launch site.
**Paragliding hours:** From 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM
**Paragliding price per person:** Range from 1,700,000 to 1,950,000 VND (Approximately $67 to $77)
**The Duong May Paragliding Club organizes flights.**
## Highlights
**Breathtaking views:** Soar high above Da Nang for panoramic vistas of the city, beaches, forests, and the East Sea.
**Bird’s-eye perspective:** See the landscape unfold beneath you, revealing hidden coves, winding roads, and tiny boats.

**Memorable photos:** Capture stunning aerial shots to share your adventure with friends and family.
## Tips for Going Paragliding
**1. Comfortable attire** : Choose comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that allows for easy movement. Avoid skirts, dresses, and tight-fitting jeans. Opt for stretchy pants or shorts instead.
**2. Wear supportive shoes** : Wear sneakers or other closed-toe shoes that provide good grip and support. You’ll need to run for takeoff, so proper footwear is essential.
**3. Sunglasses, and sunscreen** :
**4. Health advisories:** Paragliding is not suitable for individuals with heart conditions, joint problems, or pregnancy. If you have any medical concerns, consult with your doctor before participating.
**5. Enjoy the view, relax** : Focus on enjoying the scenery and the experience, rather than constantly worrying about the camera. Relax and take in the breathtaking views.
**6. Colorful clothing:** Brightly colored clothing tends to photograph better, so feel free to add a splash of color to your paragliding attire.
**7. Pay attention to pre-flight instructions:** Listen carefully to your instructor’s pre-flight instructions. They will provide important safety guidelines and explain the paragliding process.

# Vietnamese Tea: A Comprehensive Guide to its History, Varieties, and Culture
[](https://vivavn.com/category/discover/)
10 min
[](https://vivavn.com/tea/)
Tea
_Vietnamese people drink tea all year round. For them, sipping a cup of tea is not just about enjoying the taste, but also about initiating conversations, turning unfamiliar encounters into friendships. In this article, let’s explore the fascinating aspects of tea culture in Vietnam._
## Introduction
Vietnam boasts a millennia-old love affair with tea. Evidence of this deep-rooted tradition can be found in the writings of scholar Phạm Đình Hổ (1768 – 1839) within his book “Vũ trung tùy bút,” which mentions the custom of tea drinking dating back thousands of years.
Further solidifying this history, the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences unearthed fossilized tea leaves and plants in Phú Thọ Province. This region, considered the ancestral land of the Vietnamese people, is where the Hung Kings established the Văn Lang state around the 7th century BC.
In the past, tea was considered a luxury drink only enjoyed by royalty or the upper class. The rituals of making and drinking tea were also quite elaborate, requiring the person serving the tea to show respect for their elders and superiors.
Nowadays, the tea drinking culture of Vietnamese people is present everywhere, regardless of rich or poor, noble or humble. Whether it is a noble family or an ordinary family, whether it is a stall in the market or a high-class restaurant, … everyone can freely sip a cup of hot tea. Especially during major celebrations like weddings, funerals, ancestral worship, or even on ordinary days, tea is cherished and savored.
## Types of Vietnamese tea
### Vietnamese green tea
Image: Trà Xanh Hữu Cơ Thái Nguyên
Green tea reigns supreme in Vietnam, the most popular choice among tea drinkers. With its unoxidized leaves, it maintains the pure essence of tea. Once brewed, it presents a bright hue, gentle aroma, and a hint of bitterness. Rich in [EGCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigallocatechin_gallate), a robust antioxidant, green tea is renowned for its heart-protective benefits.
### Vietnamese black tea
Black tea is a type of tea whose tea leaves undergo complete oxidation, resulting in a final result with a dark brown color. When brewed, black tea produces a dark brown drink with a stronger flavor compared to other types of tea.
### Vietnamese oolong tea
Unlike black tea and green tea, oolong occupies a fascinating middle ground. Its leaves undergo partial oxidation, anywhere from 8% to 80%, creating a spectrum of colors and a wide range of flavors and aromas. Oolong tea is usually rolled into small, round balls. This is a signature feature of oolong tea, making it easy to spot!
### Vietnamese specialty teas
#### Vietnamese lotus tea
Image: Trà Sen Tây Hồ
For a truly unique tea experience, try [Vietnamese lotus tea](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-lotus-tea/)! It’s a unique blend of green tea and the delicate fragrance of lotus flowers, creating a truly unique aroma and taste.
Making lotus tea is an art form. Skilled tea makers carefully select lotus buds that have just bloomed in the early morning. These hold the purest essence of the flower’s fragrance.
Here’s the fascinating part: the tea leaves are tucked inside the lotus buds. Then, the whole thing is tied shut and wrapped in a protective layer of lotus leaves. Left to rest overnight, the tea absorbs the flower’s wonderful essence.
The next day, the tea is ready to be brewed. Take a sip, and you’ll be transported to a Vietnamese garden filled with the delicate scent of lotus flowers.
#### Vietnamese jasmine tea
Jasmine tea is a delicious Vietnamese drink packed with health benefits. It’s made by combining green tea, with fragrant jasmine flowers, creating a captivating aroma and taste.
To make jasmine tea, jasmine flowers are picked at their peak fragrance and placed in a small porcelain bowl. Green tea is then added on top, and the bowl is covered tightly. The tea is left to absorb the jasmine’s fragrance for several hours.
Once the tea has absorbed the jasmine’s fragrance the flowers are gently removed. Now comes the best part: brewing the tea with hot water. It can be enjoyed steaming hot or chilled for a refreshing treat.
#### Vietnamese cinnamon tea
[Vietnamese cinnamon](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-cinnamon/) tea is a delicious and warming drink made with just a few simple ingredients. To make it, place a cinnamon stick and some honey in a cup, then pour in boiled water. Let it steep for 10-15 minutes, and enjoy!
#### Vietnamese gotu kola tea
[Gotu kola tea](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-gotu-kola-tea/) is usually brewed by steeping dried gotu kola leaves in hot water. This tea has a delicate, nuanced flavor that’s slightly grassy and subtly sweet. It can be savored plain or enhanced with additional flavors like lemon, or honey.
#### Vietnamese artichoke tea
In Vietnam, there are two types of tea called artichoke tea: green artichoke tea and red artichoke tea. They come from different plants and taste different.
Green artichoke tea is made from the Cynara Scolymus plant.
Red artichoke tea is made from the Hibiscus Sabdariffa plant.
The next time you’re in Vietnam, be sure to try [both types of artichoke tea](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-artichoke-tea/) and see which one you prefer!
#### Vietnamese ginger tea
Feeling under the weather? In Vietnam, we have a comforting drink called ginger tea. It’s a simple recipe made by simmering sliced ginger in water. Then, we add a squeeze of fresh lemon and a touch of honey for a soothing warm drink. Perfect for easing a sore throat or a stuffy nose!
## Where Vietnam’s Finest Teas Are Cultivated
### Northwest (Tay Bac)
Tay Bac (literally “Northwest”) is one of Vietnam’s regions, located in the mountainous northwestern part of the country. It includes six provinces: Dien Bien, Lai Chau, Son La, Hoa Binh, Lao Cai, and Yen Bai.
This region is home to a special tea called [Shan Tuyet](https://vivavn.com/shan-tuyet-tea/). These aren’t your usual tea plants; they’re hundreds of years old and really tall! They like to live up in the clouds, above 1200 meters, where it’s cool and misty all year round. The best part? They’re grown completely naturally, without any chemicals.
Shan Tuyet tea smells wonderful and has a beautiful golden color, like honey. The people who live in the mountains, the Tay, Mong, and Dao, make the tea using special methods that have been around for a long time.
### Thai Nguyen province
Nestled in Vietnam’s Northeast region, Thai Nguyen province is a mountainous paradise famous for its lush tea plantations. With over 16,000 hectares dedicated to tea cultivation, the region boasts ideal soil and climate conditions for nurturing the finest tea plants.
Early each morning, while the dew still glistens on the leaves, local farmers carefully handpick the freshest tea leaves. These leaves are then meticulously processed and crafted into the exquisite tea that Thai Nguyen is renowned for.
Thai Nguyen tea captivates drinkers with its striking color and distinctive flavor profile. Its brewed infusion presents an invitingly bright golden hue, accompanied by a gentle, refreshing aroma. Sipping Thai Nguyen tea delivers a subtle, pleasantly mild bitterness followed by a lingering, sweet aftertaste.
Among the many tea-growing regions in Thai Nguyen, Tan Cuong takes the crown. Their tea is legendary for its exceptional quality and taste.
### Bao Loc – Lam Dong
Image: Trà Trí Việt
Back in the early 1930s, the French discovered a hidden gem in Vietnam’s mountains: the Bao Loc region (formerly known as B’lao). They saw the perfect place to grow exceptional tea. And guess what? They were right!
Nestled at an altitude of 800-1,000 meters above sea level, Bao Loc boasts fertile soil and a climate that’s perfect for tea plants. This ideal environment, along with careful cultivation, is the secret behind the consistently high quality of Bao Loc tea.
So, what makes Bao Loc tea so special? Take a sip, and you’ll be greeted by a delightful aroma and a unique sweet taste that sets it apart. This region is especially famous for its Oolong tea, a variety prized for its complex and satisfying flavor profile.
## Vietnamese Tea Culture
In Vietnam, tea isn’t just a drink, it’s a cultural tradition. It’s enjoyed everywhere, from bustling cities to quiet villages. Step inside a Vietnamese home, and a steaming cup of tea might be the first thing offered. It’s a warm welcome. The same goes for special occasions – holidays, weddings, family reunions – tea is always there, bringing people together.
### The art of tea drinking in Vietnam
In Vietnam, there’s a whole art form to enjoying tea! The Vietnamese take their time, savoring every step of the experience. They first bring the cup to their nose, to savor the aroma. Then, they take a small sip, enjoying the initial bitterness followed by a wave of sweetness that leaves a refreshing feeling. It’s a truly mindful way to appreciate the subtle flavors of tea.
#### Water
The water used to make tea is considered very important. In the past, it was traditionally rainwater collected from the sky or sourced from natural springs. Some people would even go as far as to collect dew from lotus leaves early in the morning.
#### Time
The time of day when tea is consumed is also important. Tea connoisseurs believe that drinking tea in the early morning (between 4-5 AM) is best for both health and mind. It helps to set the tone for the day and focus on positive thoughts.
#### Space
The space should be a wide-open space that allows for a sense of peace and tranquility. Ideally, it should be surrounded by nature and decorated with artwork, calligraphy, or other objects that promote relaxation and contemplation.
## Summary
Vietnam has a long history of tea drinking, dating back thousands of years.
Vietnam offers a wide variety of teas, from classic green and black to unique options like lotus and jasmine, each with its own flavor profile and purpose.
Vietnam boasts tea-growing regions like Tay Bac for naturally-grown Shan Tuyet, Thai Nguyen for its Tan Cuong, and Bao Loc for its French-discovered sweet Oolong tea.
Tea is offered as a gesture of hospitality and enjoyed during social gatherings.
The Vietnamese prioritize the leisurely enjoyment of tea, with emphasis on savoring its aroma and taste, sometimes considering factors like water source and time of day, within tranquil settings for consumption.

## What makes Lo Gach Cu Farm special?
Unlike [Tra Que Vegetable Village](https://vivavn.com/tra-que-vegetable-village/), a beautiful village in the [Hoi An countryside](https://vivavn.com/hoi-an-villages/) focused solely on growing [vegetables and herbs](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/), Lo Gach Cu Farm is dedicated to rice cultivation. This unique farm offers visitors a chance to experience a different aspect of [rural life in Vietnam](https://vivavn.com/category/countryside/). Let’s dive into what makes this place so appealing and what you can discover during your visit!
### The countryside scenery is picturesque
Imagine lush green rice fields stretching as far as the eye can see, with diligent farmers tending to their crops. In the distance, you can spot water buffalo leisurely grazing. Nestled within this picturesque scene is a charming little farm next to an old, abandoned brick kiln that has been repurposed for visitors to take photos. The scenery here becomes truly enchanting during sunrise and sunset. Isn’t that captivating?
A few decades ago, brick kilns were busy places where bricks were made from clay. They didn’t just make building materials; they also helped the local economy by creating jobs for people in rural Vietnam. But now, due to new technology and changes in the market, many of these kilns are no longer in use. Some have been torn down, while others are just left abandoned.
### The landscape changes during the year
Here, rice is grown twice a year. The first season starts in January and ends in May, while the second season begins in June and wraps up in September. What’s fascinating is how the landscape changes throughout the year, depending on each stage of the growing season. Let us help you explore it in more detail:

If you visit in early January, you’ll find the fields covered in a gray blanket of soil, with farmers busy preparing seeds for the new planting season. From late January through March, the young rice plants start to cover the fields in vibrant green, creating a lush landscape that’s truly a sight to behold.
By early April, the rice begins to ripen and take on a golden hue, and by late April, the fields are ablaze with bright yellow. This is when the village gears up for the harvest, which starts in early May and lasts for about two weeks. As May comes to a close and the harvest wraps up, the fields appear barren, and farmers take a break before the next planting season begins.

In early June, it’s time for the farmers to sow seeds for the new crop, kicking off another cycle. By July and August, the fields are green and thriving once again, leading up to another harvest in late August and September.
The last three months of the year mark the rainy season, making it impossible to grow rice. October and November often bring floods that can inundate the fields. Come December, the farmers return to the fields to clear weeds and till the soil in preparation for the new planting season.

# Vietnamese Organic Products
We offer you a list of best organic products from Vietnam
10 min
[](https://vivavn.com/category/organic-products/)
Organic products
## Organic rice
Image: Gao Huu Co Quang Tri
Beyond its well-established position as a rice giant, Vietnam is witnessing a flourishing trend: [organic rice farming](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-organic-rice/). This shift prioritizes quality over shortcuts, with organic practices ensuring grains free from harmful chemicals. The result? Rice rich in nutrients, boasting a purer taste, and contributing to a healthier planet. [Quang Tri Organic Rice](https://vivavn.com/quang-tri-organic-rice/) exemplifies this dedication, employing strict organic methods.
Their dedication has earned recognition at home and has even allowed them to enter European markets. With the growing demand for organic food worldwide, Vietnamese farmers, equipped with their knowledge and commitment to sustainable methods, are ready to take on significant roles in this changing market.
## Organic tea
Image: Che huu co Bac Ha
Vietnam is one of the world’s leading tea producers, ranking fifth in terms of area under tea cultivation and sixth in terms of production.
Vietnam is home to over 170 varieties of [tea](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-tea/), but one of the most famous is Shan Tuyet. This specialty tea is grown in mountainous areas at an altitude of 1200 meters or above, where the climate is cool and cloudy year-round. The large temperature difference between day and night creates ideal conditions for the growth of Shan Tuyet tea trees.
Image: Che huu co Bac Ha
These trees, which can live for hundreds of years, are carefully tended to by generations of Tay, Dao, and Mong ethnic people in the provinces of Ha Giang, Bac Kan, Dien Bien, Lao Cai, and Yen Bai. Shan Tuyet tea is cultivated completely naturally, without the use of inorganic fertilizers or pesticides.
As a result, Shan Tuyet tea is known for its unique flavor and aroma. It is said to have a sweet, slightly bitter taste with a lingering aftertaste. The tea is also rich in antioxidants and other beneficial nutrients.
Shan Tuyet tea is a popular choice for both domestic and international consumers. For example, Bac Ha district in Lao Cai province is home to 950 hectares of tea, of which 700 hectares are organic. The “Ban Lien Shan Tuyet Tea” brand from Bac Ha district is a 5-star [OCOP ](https://vivavn.com/what-is-ocop-vietnam/)product that has successfully conquered the European market.
OCOP is a Vietnamese government program that aims to promote the development of local products. The program was launched in 2018 and is based on the idea of “One Commune One Product.” This means that each commune (a small administrative unit in Vietnam) is encouraged to develop and promote a single product that is unique to its locality.
## Organic coconut
[The coconut tree](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coconut/) is one of [the most widely cultivated plants](https://vivavn.com/the-most-cultivated-trees-in-vietnam/) in Vietnam, with a major concentration in the [Mekong Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekong_Delta). The provinces of Ben Tre and Tra Vinh are the leading coconut producers in the country, and both have a significant area under organic coconut cultivation.
Coconut farmers are increasingly embracing organic farming methods as a way to ensure the long-term sustainability of the crop.
There is a growing range of organic coconut products available on the market, including: Organic coconut water, organic coconut oil, organic coconut nectar…
One example of a high-quality organic coconut product is [Sokfarm Organic Coconut Nectar ](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coconut-nectar/)from Tra Vinh province. This nectar is a natural sweetener that is rich in nutrients and has a low glycemic index.
## Organic cinnamon
Did you know Vietnam ranks third globally in the world of cinnamon? With 150,000 hectares dedicated to growing it, cinnamon is a fragrant part of Vietnam’s farming.
[Vietnamese cinnamon](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-cinnamon/) is distributed in most regions of the country. However, the four most concentrated cinnamon growing areas are Yen Bai, Lao Cai, Thanh Hoa – Nghe An, and Quang Nam – Quang Ngai.
Yen Bai is the province with the largest cinnamon cultivation area in Vietnam, with over 81,000 hectares. Cinnamon in Yen Bai is mainly concentrated in the districts of Van Yen (accounting for 55% of the cinnamon area in the province), Tran Yen (23%), Van Chan (11%)…
Dao Thinh commune, located in the Tran Yen district of Yen Bai province, is the commune with the largest area of organic cinnamon in Yen Bai province (800 hectares). It is a shining example of sustainable production.
In Dao Thinh, farmers are committed to organic practices, following strict standards that ensure the purity and quality of their cinnamon. The use of chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides is strictly prohibited, allowing the trees to thrive naturally. As a result, products like organic cinnamon essential oil and cinnamon powder from this region have gained significant popularity among customers.
## Organic black peppercorns
Boasting a global crown, Vietnam reigns supreme as the world’s leading producer and exporter of pepper, claiming over 40% of global production and a staggering 60% of the export market. The Central Highlands and Southeast regions hold the keys to this dominance, contributing approximately 94% of the country’s pepper-growing area and a massive 97% of its production. (This data is according to the Vietnam Pepper Association, 2023)
Embracing a sustainable future, farmers in these regions are increasingly adopting organic farming practices, fostering the development of dedicated organic pepper production areas.

FAQs
## What is water spinach?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** _rau muong_
**Shape and appearance:** Long, hollow stems divided by nodes, soft in texture, and green or purplish in color. Leaves vary in shape—some are arrowhead-like with pointed tips, while others are narrow and elongated. 
**Habitat** : Grows both on land and in water.
**How to enjoy it:** In Vietnamese cuisine, it’s commonly stir-fried with garlic, boiled and served with dipping sauce, or cooked into soup with shrimp.
**Harvest season:** Grown year-round in Vietnam, thanks to its fast growth and adaptability.
### **Two main types of water spinach in Vietnam:**
There are two main types of water spinach in Vietnam: upland (dryland) water spinach, which is commonly grown in home gardens, and aquatic water spinach, typically grown in ponds or flooded fields, often with longer stems and the ability to be harvested multiple times. Both types are used similarly in cooking, though the aquatic variety is more common in large-scale farming.

#### Leaf shape: upland vs aquatic varieties
Depending on growing conditions, water spinach develops two distinct leaf types. The upland variety, often grown in soil, tends to have slender, elongated leaves. The aquatic variety, which thrives in water, produces shorter, arrowhead-shaped leaves with pointed tips.

_Image: Close-up of aquatic water spinach with arrowhead-shaped leaves growing in water_
#### Stem characteristics: upland vs aquatic types
Both kinds of water spinach have hollow stems with clear segments. But the way they grow makes a big difference. The upland type, which grows in soil, has slimmer, straighter stems that are light green. The water-grown variety has thicker stems that are heavier and float on water. These stems can be green or purple.

## **Cultivating and harvesting water spinach**
In Vietnam’s tropical climate, water spinach grows easily, whether it’s cultivated on dry land or in wet conditions. Both types are typically grown from seeds, though the water-grown variety can also be propagated from cuttings. After just 20 to 25 days, the plants are ready for harvest. For upland water spinach, farmers usually harvest the entire plant.
But when it comes to the water-grown kind, they use scissors to cut the stems, leaving about 7 to 10 centimeters at the base. This allows the plant to regrow and be harvested again several more times.

###  **Stir-fried water spinach with garlic** (rau muong xao toi)

###  **Water spinach soup with shrimp (canh rau muong nau voi tom)**  

Water spinach soup with shrimp is a beloved everyday dish in Vietnamese homes. It’s light, flavorful, and comes together quickly—perfect for a family meal. The recipe starts with peeled shrimp, which are sautéed with garlic, shallots, and a touch of oil. A splash of [fish sauce](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fish-sauce/) adds that signature depth of flavor common in Vietnamese cooking.
Once the shrimp are fragrant and just cooked, water is added to create the broth. Finally, fresh water spinach is tossed in and gently simmered until just tender. The result is a refreshing, slightly savory soup that pairs beautifully with steamed rice.

For extra flavor, thinly sliced garlic and chili can be added to the soy sauce, creating a savory and slightly spicy dip. This dish is often enjoyed with plain rice, offering a clean, refreshing contrast to richer main courses.

### Taste and flavor
Longans are sweet and tender, with a juicy texture and just a bit of crispness. After eating, you’ll notice a subtle musky aftertaste that lingers on your tongue. When you peel the fruit, it releases a gentle and pleasant aroma.
### Longan vs lychee
Some of you may get confused between longan and lychee. To help clear up the confusion, we’ve put together a comparison of the two fruits. With key differences in appearance, texture, and taste, you’ll no longer struggle to tell longan and lychee apart!
### Longan
**Shape and appearance** : round shape and thin, brown, leathery skin.
**Texture** : Longan has flesh that is thinner and slightly crispier than lychee’s.
**Taste:** Longan has a sweet, and musky flavor.
### Lychee
**Shape and appearance** : round or heart-shaped with a rough, pink or red rind.
**Texture:** The texture of lychee is soft, juicy, and similar to jelly.
**Taste:** Lychee has a sweet, a bit of a sour taste, and a perfumed flavor.
## How to eat Vietnamese longan
The skin of a longan is thin and easy to peel. Simply use your thumbs to gently remove the outer layer, or make a light cut with a knife to peel it off.
After peeling, you can pop the longan into your mouth and use your teeth to separate the flesh from the seed—just don’t chew or swallow the seed. Alternatively, you can use your fingers to remove the flesh from the seed and then enjoy the fruit.
## Nutritional facts of Longan
Here’s the nutritional breakdown for a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of longan, based on data from the **[USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/169089/nutrients)** :
**Nutrient** | **Amount**  
---|---

## How to pick delicious Vietnamese longan fruits
When choosing longan, look for bunches that come with stems. The fruit should have a shiny, firm skin and vibrant color, with fresh leaves that emit a pleasant aroma. Avoid fruits that are leaking juice, mushy, damp, have cracked skins, or show dark spots.
To test for ripeness, gently squeeze the longan with your fingers. If it feels slightly soft but not too firm, it’s a sign that the fruit is juicy and ripe.

Longans are a deliciously sweet and juicy fruit that can be enjoyed on their own or as part of a refreshing dessert. To make the most of their flavor and extend their shelf life, it’s important to store them properly. If you’ve just picked up a fresh batch from the market, follow these simple steps to keep your longans fresh and tasty for days to come.
**Step 1:** Give the longans a good rinse under cool running water, then gently snip them off the branches. Set them aside to air dry.
**Step 2:** Carefully inspect the longans, discarding any that are bruised, overly soft, or show signs of mold or pests.

## The uses of longan in traditional Vietnamese medicine
Image credit: Long Nhãn Sấy Khô Hưng Yên
In traditional Vietnamese medicine, longans are preserved by drying the fruit. After drying, they develop a rich yellow or dark brown color. The dried longans become soft and chewy, with a sweet flavor and a subtle, distinctive aroma. They can be used alone or combined with other herbs to create remedies for various conditions, such as boosting energy, improving memory, and combating skin aging.
These are the uses according to traditional Vietnamese medicine, and no scientific research has yet confirmed or disproved them.
## Traditional Vietnamese recipes with longan
### 1. Vietnamese longan and lotus seed sweet soup
**Ingredients:**
Fresh lotus seeds
Fresh longans
Rock sugar
Water
Ice cubes (for serving chilled)
**Here’s how it’s made:**
Start by boiling the fresh lotus seeds until tender, then drain and set them aside. Next, carefully peel the longans, making sure to remove the seeds while keeping the fruit whole. Gently stuff each lotus seed into the hollowed-out longans.
In a pot, dissolve the rock sugar in water and bring it to a simmer. Add the stuffed longans and let them cook briefly—just enough for them to soak up the sweet syrup. Remove the pot from heat and let the soup cool to room temperature. For a refreshing finish, chill the soup in the refrigerator.
When you’re ready to serve, ladle the soup into bowls, garnishing with extra lotus seeds and ice cubes. This dessert is light, refreshing, and perfect for a warm day!
### 2. Longan tea
**Ingredients:**
Fresh longans
Jasmine tea bags
Rock sugar
Granulated sugar
Water, ice cubes, and salt
**Here’s how it’s made:**
**Prepare the Longans:** Peel the longans, remove the seeds, and rinse the fruit with warm water. Sweeten the longan flesh with granulated sugar and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes.
**Cook the Longan Syrup:** In a pot, bring water to a boil with rock sugar and a pinch of salt. Once the sugar and salt have dissolved, add the sweetened longan flesh and cook until the longans turn opaque and the syrup thickens. Then remove from heat.
**Brew the Tea:** Steep the jasmine tea bags in hot water for about 5 to 8 minutes.
**Mix the Drink:** Combine some jasmine tea with a portion of the longan syrup and a few ice cubes. Stir well, pour into a glass, and enjoy!

# Vietnamese Coconut Nectar: Sokfarm’s Sustainable Sweetener
Introducing Vietnamese coconut nectar and the famous Sokfarm brand that produces organic coconut nectar.

Coconut
## Introduction
Image: Sokfarm – Tra Vinh Organic Coconut Nectar
Coconut nectar is the purest product of [the coconut tree](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coconut/), collected from the unopened coconut flower buds, which contain a high concentration of nutrients that nourish all parts of the coconut fruit.
Vietnamese coconut nectar is gaining popularity worldwide as an organic product that not only tastes delicious but also offers health benefits. It is rich in nutrients and minerals, including potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc.
The harvesting and processing of coconut nectar are traditionally carried out by the Khmer people in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam’s largest coconut-growing region.
## The allure of Sokfarm coconut nectar
Image: Sokfarm – Tra Vinh Organic Coconut Nectar
Vietnamese brand, Sokfarm, stands out as a pioneer in organic coconut nectar production. Their commitment to sustainability extends from organically cultivating coconut trees to responsible nectar collection, ensuring the well-being of the environment and ecosystem.
###  Unique flavor
Image: Sokfarm – Tra Vinh Organic Coconut Nectar
Sokfarm coconut nectar has a unique flavor profile that is characterized by its sweetness, mineral notes, and slightly sour aftertaste.
The sweetness of Vietnamese coconut nectar is unique, offering a delicate flavor derived from coconut flowers. The high concentration of minerals in the nectar, such as potassium, magnesium, and iron, not only enhances its overall flavor but also provides numerous health benefits.
The slightly sour aftertaste of Vietnamese coconut nectar is due to the natural fermentation process that takes place after the nectar is collected. This fermentation process gives the nectar a unique flavor that is both sweet and sour.
### A natural source of vitamins and minerals
Sokfarm fresh coconut nectar is rich in important minerals such as iron, zinc, calcium, kali, natri, and potassium, as well as other nutrients such as 17 amino acids. These ingredients provide energy, electrolytes, and support the body during exercise and recovery.
Sokfarm Organic Coconut Nectar has a low glycemic index (GI) of 55, compared to refined sugar which has a GI of around 85 and honey which has an average GI of 60. A low GI is ideal for those looking to stabilize their blood sugar levels.
### Purely organic
Fresh coconut nectar serves as a natural and organic sweetener, free from additives and artificial ingredients. Sokfarm is dedicated to the sustainable production of coconut nectar. Collaborating with local coconut farmers, the company imparts organic farming techniques and traditional [Khmer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_people)methods for collecting nectar from coconut flowers.
## Sokfarm’s commitment to sustainable harvesting: the secret behind their delicious nectar
Image: Sokfarm – Tra Vinh Organic Coconut Nectar
### 1. Choosing the perfect tree:
Coconut trees have to be at least 3 years old and consistently producing fruit before they’re ready for nectar collection. This ensures the tree is mature and healthy. Each tree contributes for 9 months, followed by a 3-month rest period to recover.
### 2. Waking up the flowers
Image: Sokfarm – Tra Vinh Organic Coconut Nectar
Skilled harvesters climb the trees to find unopened coconut flowers. They gently massage the flowers to stimulate nectar production. Then, using a wooden pestle, they carefully tap the flowers to encourage even more nectar flow. Experienced harvesters know exactly how much pressure to apply – too much can damage the flower, while too little won’t stimulate enough nectar.
### 3. Collecting the liquid gold
Image: Sokfarm – Tra Vinh Organic Coconut Nectar
Once the flowers are prepared, the harvester uses a small knife to make a precise cut at the tip, allowing the nectar to drip out. A special container collects the precious liquid as it flows from the flower.
### 4. From blossom to bottle
Image: Sokfarm – Tra Vinh Organic Coconut Nectar
After harvesting, the fresh coconut nectar is transported to Sokfarm’s facilities. Here, it’s transformed into a variety of delicious and versatile products, including fermented coconut nectar, concentrated nectar, coconut sugar, and even coconut nectar-infused soy sauce and vinegar.
## How a couple revived a community with Sokfarm
Image: Sokfarm – Tra Vinh Organic Coconut Nectar
Chal Thi grew up in a small village in Tra Vinh Province, Vietnam, surrounded by coconut trees. She loved coconuts and dreamed of doing something to improve the lives of coconut farmers in her community.
After graduating from college with a degree in food technology, Chal Thi got a stable job in Ho Chi Minh City. In 2018, Chal Thi heard from her father that the price of coconuts had plummeted. Farmers were struggling to make a living. Chal Thi decided to quit her job and return to her hometown to help.
She and her husband, Pham Dinh Ngai, an electrical engineer who shared her passion for coconuts. Together, they decided to start a business producing coconut nectar, a traditional Khmer product.
At first, they faced many challenges. They failed repeatedly and were met with skepticism from local farmers. But Chal Thi and Ngai were determined to succeed.
They learned the traditional methods of collecting coconut nectar from the village elders. They experimented with different processing techniques and eventually developed a high-quality product.
In 2019, Chal Thi and Ngai launched their company, Sokfarm. Today, they sell their products to customers all over Vietnam and are even exporting to other countries.
Sokfarm provides a stable income for hundreds of local coconut farmers. Over 70% of the company’s workforce are women. The company has developed over 20 hectares of organic coconut farms.
In July 2023, Sokfarm’s coconut nectar was awarded a 5-star OCOP certification by the Vietnamese government. This is the highest rating possible under the [OCOP ](https://vivavn.com/what-is-ocop-vietnam/)program. Sokfarm was also one of 30 businesses in Vietnam recognized in 2023 for its outstanding social impact and climate-resilient farming methods.
### Aspiration for sustainable agriculture
Tra Vinh, a province located in the Mekong Delta region, faces a grim outlook. Scientists predict that within the next 30-50 years, climate change will cause approximately 30% of the area to be submerged or infiltrated by saline water, rendering many crops unable to thrive.
However, coconut trees stand out as resilient to saline inundation, though their productivity and quality will inevitably suffer. In response to this challenge, Sokfarm has transitioned to a coconut farming model centered around harvesting coconut flower nectar. This innovative approach not only ensures the sustainability of farming practices but also significantly boosts farmers’ income by 3-5 times.
Sokfarm employs the traditional method of the Khmer people to harvest coconut flower nectar. This contributes to the preservation of the traditional industry for the local community.
In addition, coconut gardens that produce coconut nectar also provide eco-tourism opportunities for visitors from around the world to witness firsthand how locals produce organic coconut nectar. The couple aims to promote sustainable agriculture, partnering with local farmers to introduce coconut nectar products to a global market.

_In this article, we’re about to unlock the secrets of Vietnamese starfruit, a fruit that’s as intriguing as it is delicious. We’ll explore its distinctive shape and tangy flavor, share tips on how to enjoy it and guide you in selecting the perfect, ripe starfruit. You’ll also discover how starfruit is used in Vietnamese cuisine. Plus, we’ll tell you a beloved Vietnamese folktale about the starfruit tree, a story every child in Vietnam grows up hearing. And to test your newfound knowledge, we’ve included some fun trivia questions about this fascinating fruit! Whether you’re a food lover or just curious about Vietnamese culture, there’s something here for you!_
## What is Vietnamese star fruit?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** khế
**Shape and appearance:** Starfruit has a star-shaped cross-section when sliced, with smooth, shiny skin ranging from green to yellow. It is crisp and juicy with some seeds inside.
**Flavor profile:** Sweet with a hint of tanginess, and a refreshing, slightly citrusy taste.
**How to enjoy it:** Eat fresh, slice it into star shapes, or blend it into smoothies.
**Harvest season:** Available year-round, with peak season from late summer to late autumn.
### Shape and color
Vietnamese starfruit, or khế, has a distinctive shape with a length ranging from 5 to 15 cm. When sliced crosswise, it reveals a star-like pattern, which is how it got its name. The **[fruit](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/)** grows in clusters and starts green, turning yellow as it ripens. Inside, you’ll find small, brown seeds located in the center.
Starfruit trees typically reach a height of 3 to 6 meters and have lush, dense foliage with pretty clusters of purple flowers. They bear fruit year-round, adding a touch of vibrant color to gardens throughout the seasons.

### Taste and flavor
In **[Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam)** , there are two main types of starfruit: the sweet variety and the sour variety.
The sweet starfruit has a mild flavor with a hint of tartness. It is usually low in sugar content (around 4%), giving it a gentle, not overly sweet taste. When ripe, the sweet starfruit is juicy, with a crisp texture similar to grapes, and has a light, refreshing flavor.
On the other hand, the sour starfruit has a sharper, tangier taste, similar to that of green apples. When unripe, it is firm and has a distinct sourness. This type of starfruit is often used in cooking to add a zesty, tangy flavor to dishes.
## How to eat the star fruit
To enjoy starfruit, follow these simple steps:
**Wash the Fruit** : Rinse the starfruit under cold water to remove any dirt or residues.
**Slice the Fruit** : Use a sharp knife to cut the starfruit crosswise into slices. Each slice will have a star shape.
**Eat Fresh** : You can eat the slices directly as a fresh snack. The skin is edible and has a mild flavor.
**Remove Seeds (Optional)** : While the seeds are edible, you might prefer to remove them for a smoother eating experience.
**Try in Recipes** : Starfruit can also be used in salads, salsas, or as a garnish for various dishes.
## How to choose a ripe starfruit
To select a ripe starfruit, look for one that is mostly yellow with a hint of light green. The skin should be slightly waxy, and the edges will have brown ridges. The fruit should feel firm to the touch.
Avoid starfruit that is overly yellow with brown spots, as this indicates that it may be overripe and could taste bland and have a soggier texture. Remember, if the starfruit is still slightly green, it can ripen at room temperature, but its sweetness won’t increase.
## Starfruit in Vietnamese cuisine
The Vietnamese starfruit soup with beef, or ‘Canh Khế Thịt Bò,’ offers a tangy and savory flavor profile. The starfruit brings a refreshing tartness that complements the rich taste of tender beef. This combination is elevated by the fragrant aroma of green onions and shallots, along with the depth added by traditional Vietnamese seasonings like fish sauce and black pepper. The result is a harmonious balance of tangy, savory, and aromatic elements that is both comforting and invigorating.
## A Vietnamese folktale about starfruit
In elementary school, Vietnamese students often learn about a folktale involving the starfruit tree through their textbooks.
Illustration of the Vietnamese starfruit folktale from a school textbook (Source: voh.com.vn)
In the Vietnamese folktale “The Starfruit Tree,” two brothers inherit their family’s estate after their parents pass away. The elder brother, who is lazy and selfish, convinces the younger brother to take only a small run-down hut and a starfruit tree while he keeps the larger portion of their inheritance. The younger brother and his wife work tirelessly, cultivating their land and taking care of the starfruit tree, which grows lush and bears many fruits.
One day, a giant bird arrives and starts eating the ripe starfruits. The couple, relying on the fruits for their livelihood, kindly ask the bird to stop. To their surprise, the bird speaks, promising to repay them with gold if they sew a small bag. Following the bird’s instructions, the younger brother makes a bag measuring exactly three hand spans and waits. The bird returns, carrying the younger brother on its back to a faraway island filled with precious gems and gold. He takes only enough gold to fill his small bag and returns home, now able to live comfortably but modestly.
When the elder brother learns of this, his jealousy is sparked. He convinces his younger brother to trade their small hut and the starfruit tree for his larger estate. The greedy elder brother and his wife eagerly wait for the bird. When the bird arrives and repeats the same offer, the elder brother sews a much larger bag, three times the size of the one his brother had made.
The bird, unaware of the deception, takes the elder brother to the treasure island. Greed takes over, and he stuffs the bag with as much gold and gems as he can carry, even filling his clothes. The bird struggles to fly back because of the heavy load, and eventually, over the ocean, it can no longer carry the weight. The elder brother is thrown into the sea, where he drowns, weighed down by his greed.
The story teaches a timeless lesson: those who are humble, honest, and hardworking will find true prosperity, while greed and selfishness ultimately lead to downfall.

You’ll discover what makes this hidden gem so special, learn about the unforgettable experiences waiting for you, and get tips on the best ways to get there. Plus, we’ve included all the details on ticket prices and transportation options, so you’re fully prepared for your visit. Whether you’re a nature lover or just looking for something off the beaten path, this guide has everything you need to make the most of your trip!_

Entrance fee
## What makes Cam Thanh Coconut Village special?
To start, we’d like to show you what sets the Cam Thanh Coconut Village apart from other [villages in Hoi An](https://vivavn.com/hoi-an-villages/). And just to clear up any confusion—Cam Thanh Water Coconut Forest, Bay Mau Coconut Forest, and Hoi An Coconut Forest are all different names for the same place.
### The vast, pristine water coconut forest
This charming village is nestled right next to Cua Dai Beach, covering an area of 900 hectares, with nearly half of that being water. The village is known for its network of winding rivers and a unique mangrove ecosystem, where water coconut trees thrive and provide a habitat for many fish species. The lush waterways and vibrant coconut forests are part of what makes this area so captivating for visitors exploring this region
### The peaceful countryside landscape of Hội An’s river region
Although it’s just a short distance away from the beautiful [Tra Que Vegetable Village](https://vivavn.com/tra-que-vegetable-village/) (about 5 kilometers), the countryside here offers a different charm. While Tra Que is known for its homes nestled among gardens of fresh herbs and vegetables, Cam Thanh greets you with delightful little houses that line the riverbanks, hidden behind rows of swaying coconut palms. Strolling through the villages of Cam Thanh, you can truly feel the peaceful and refreshing atmosphere that makes this place so special.
Two hundred years ago, there were no water coconut trees in Cam Thanh. The locals brought these trees from the southwestern region of Vietnam and planted them here. Thanks to the favorable soil and climate, the water coconuts thrived, and today, the village boasts around 300 hectares of these lush palms.
## What exciting experiences await you in Cam Thanh coconut village?
Compared to other countryside areas in Hoi An, the experience at the Cam Thanh water coconut forest revolves primarily around the water. To fully appreciate the beauty of this region, you’ll want to hop on a local basket boat, known as a thúng, and explore the landscapes. Along the way, you can enjoy fun activities.
### Ride in a basket boat
When you visit this village, one experience you definitely shouldn’t miss is riding in a basket boat. Each boat can hold up to four people, and a skilled local will guide you through the beautiful water coconut forests. You’ll be thrilled as they show off their amazing rowing skills with a performance known as ‘boat dancing.’ Plus, you’ll get to watch local fishermen expertly casting their nets.
### Create adorable handmade crafts using water coconut leaves
You might not know this, but the locals here make the most of water coconut leaves. They use them for thatching roofs, as firewood, and even to create beautiful handmade crafts. The residents will happily show you how to transform these leaves into charming items like bracelets, rings, sunglasses, and adorable little animals.
### Learn how to cook traditional Vietnamese dishes
All the restaurants in the village offer cooking classes for visitors. If you’re interested, you can sign up for a class to learn how to make traditional Vietnamese dishes like [Mì Quảng](https://vivavn.com/mi-quang-quang-noodles/), [Bánh Xèo](https://vivavn.com/banh-xeo-vietnamese-pancakes/), or a hearty Vietnamese meal using fresh, local ingredients.
## How to get to Cam Thanh Coconut Village from Hoi An Ancient Town
### Directions
Just 5 kilometers southeast of Hoi An’s Ancient Town, once you leave the old town, you have three routes to take you to the Cam Thanh Coconut Village. We recommend taking the route through Tran Nhan Tong, Nguyen Duy Hieu, and Tong Van Suong streets. Not only is this the shortest path, but you’ll also pass through a beautiful rice field along the way
### Transport
You can easily reach this village by taxi, Grab, motorbike, bicycle, or even on foot. We think the most enjoyable way to get here is by biking. As you ride, you’ll get to soak in the peaceful countryside scenery, complete with lush rice fields, grazing buffalo, and hardworking farmers going about their daily tasks.
## Is there an entrance fee for Cam Thanh Coconut Village?
Admission to the Cam Thanh Coconut Village is just 30,000 VND for adults and 15,000 VND for kids between 1 and 1.3 meters tall. Children under 1 meter can enter for free! This ticket allows you to explore the beautiful scenery of the village, but if you want to take a ride in a basket boat and join in on some fun river activities, you’ll need to purchase an additional ticket for around 150,000 VND. If you’re interested in taking cooking classes, just reach out to the local restaurants for pricing information.

# **What is Giay Cake (Banh Giay)?**
The significance of Giay cake in Vietnamese Tet.

[](https://vivavn.com/category/discover/)
Discover
_Banh Giay or Banh Day (Giay cake or Day cake), alongside[ banh Chung](https://vivavn.com/chung-cake/) (Chung cake), holds a significant place as one of the essential traditional dishes during the Vietnamese Tet holiday. In this article, let’s explore banh giay and how to make this type of cake._
## The significance of Giay cake during Tet
According to official documents in Vietnam, “banh Giay” is the correct spelling. However, some Vietnamese people often write this type of cake as “banh Day”.
In Vietnamese folklore, Giay cake, with its round shape, is seen as a representation of the sky. This cake, white in color and fitting neatly in the palm of one’s hand, features a curved top that resembles the sky. In ancient Vietnamese culture, the sky was thought to be the dwelling place of divine beings. Therefore, Giay cake is often employed in rituals to honor the sky and to seek favorable weather for a prosperous and abundant year.
The legend recounts that [Chung cake ](https://vivavn.com/chung-cake/)and Giay cake have their roots in the time of the Sixth Hung King. It is said that after successfully defeating the An invaders, during the first days of the new year, the King aimed to pass the throne to one of his princes.
To determine the successor, the King gathered his sons and declared that the one who presented a delicious dish with significance to their ancestors would inherit the throne. The princes eagerly sought various rare and precious ingredients to offer their father. Among them, only Prince Lang Lieu, the eighteenth prince, kind and dutiful but without a mother for a long time, was uncertain about his choice.
One night, Lang Lieu dreamt of a deity guiding him: ‘Nothing in the world is as precious as rice grains, the sustenance of human life. Mold rice into round and square shapes, symbolizing Earth and Heaven. Wrap them with leaves and place the filling inside to symbolize the grace of childbirth from parents.’ When Lang Lieu presented the dish to the King, he was delighted to discover the tasty and meaningful Chung cake and Giay cake. Consequently, the King passed the throne to Lang Liêu. The origin of Chung cake and Giay cake can be traced back to this legend.

## What is dried rambutan?
Dried rambutan is a tropical fruit snack made by removing moisture from fresh rambutan using a freeze-drying process. In this method, the fruit is first frozen, and then the moisture is removed in a vacuum chamber by turning ice directly into vapor—a process known as [sublimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_\(phase_transition\)).
This technique helps the fruit maintain its natural shape, flavor, and nutrients. The result is a crisp, airy fruit snack that tastes sweet, floral, and slightly tangy—just like the fresh fruit, but in a convenient dried form.
**See fresh and freeze-dried rambutan in the two images below:**
The first image shows fresh rambutan with its red skin removed, revealing the juicy white flesh used in freeze-dried snacks.
The second image shows the freeze-dried version—light, crisp, and naturally sweet, with no added sugar.

## Taste and texture of dried rambutan
Dried rambutan has a naturally sweet and mildly floral flavor, similar to the fresh fruit but more concentrated. There’s also a hint of tanginess that balances the sweetness without being overpowering.
In terms of texture, freeze-dried rambutan is light, crisp, and slightly airy. It breaks apart easily in your mouth and melts gently on the tongue, similar to the texture of **[freeze-dried dragon fruit](https://vivavn.com/dried-dragon-fruit/)**.
Unlike chewy dried fruits like [**dehydrated mango**](https://vivavn.com/vietnam-dried-mango/) or [**passion fruit**](https://vivavn.com/passion-fruit/), which require more chewing, this version offers a delicate crunch that’s easy to eat.
To help you see the differences and similarities, here are three images below:
  1. **Freeze-dried rambutan** – crisp, airy, and light.
  2. **Freeze-dried dragon fruit** – with a similar melt-in-your-mouth texture.
  3. **Dehydrated mango** – chewy, flexible, and requires more bite.

## How to enjoy dried rambutan
Dried rambutan is a convenient and versatile snack you can enjoy in many ways:
**On its own** : Enjoy straight from the bag for a quick, sweet, tropical bite.
**Topping for smoothie bowls:** Sprinkle freeze-dried rambutan over smoothie bowls to add crunch.
**With yogurt or granola:** Add some crisp rambutan pieces to your morning bowl for extra flavor and texture.
**Paired with tea:** Serve alongside a cup of herbal tea for a light, refreshing treat.
## Where to buy dried rambutan
Freeze-dried rambutan isn’t always easy to find in stores, but there are a few options available online. One product made in Vietnam uses freeze-drying to preserve the fruit’s natural flavor, shape, and texture, without added sugar or preservatives. You can find it _**[here on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3GGtj99)**_ (affiliate link)

## What makes Tra Que Vegetable Village so special?
Let’s take a deep dive into the fascinating history and unique flavors of the herbs and vegetables from Tra Que Village! We’ll uncover how the locals practice organic farming and why this charming village has captured the hearts of many.
### A 400-year legacy of traditional vegetable farming
About 400 years ago, the first Vietnamese settlers arrived in this area, mostly working as farmers and fishermen. As they prepared meals, they discovered that shrimp and fish cooked with the local vegetables had a unique, delicious flavor. That’s when the villagers decided to start collecting seeds and growing these vegetables themselves, kicking off Tra Que Village’s long-standing tradition of vegetable farming.
At first, the villagers simply grew vegetables to feed their families. But as they got better at farming, they expanded their land and started selling vegetables to their neighbors. Thanks to their delicious, unique flavor, Tra Que vegetables became famous throughout the region. Today, the descendants of those early settlers still carry on the tradition of keeping vegetable farming alive in Tra Que village.
### The vegetables and herbs here have unique flavors you won’t find anywhere else
Tra Que Village grows over 40 types of vegetables, fruits, and [herbs](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/)! Some of the most popular varieties include green onions, cilantro, [Vietnamese coriander](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coriander/), Thai basil, perilla, cilantro, and even [delicious fruits](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/) like winter melon and papaya.
These plants are known for their small, thick leaves and compact stature, with many herbs boasting incredibly fragrant aromas. Locals in Hoi An often say that to truly enjoy their famous dishes like [Mì Quảng](https://vivavn.com/mi-quang-quang-noodles/) and Cao Lầu, you can’t skip the fresh greens from Tra Que Vegetable Village. They believe that these locally grown vegetables elevate the flavors.
The legend goes that the taste of the herbs and vegetables from Tra Que Village captivated the Nguyen king, leading him to rename the village after two of its plants.
In the 18th century, King Gia Long of the Nguyen Dynasty made a stop at the village. The villagers offered him the freshest and most delicious vegetables they had grown. Upon tasting them, the king was particularly impressed by a type of vegetable with a fragrant aroma like camellia and a spicy flavor reminiscent of cinnamon. After returning to the capital, he issued a decree changing the name of the village to Tra Que, which means “camellia and cinnamon” in Vietnamese.
### Farmers use organic methods to promote sustainability and protect the environment.
Farmers in Tra Que Vegetable Village grow their vegetables using traditional methods passed down through generations. When you visit, you’ll notice that their farming tools are quite simple and handmade. They cultivate native seeds that have thrived in this land for hundreds of years, perfectly suited to the local soil.
These farmers are very mindful of protecting their farmland, so they avoid using chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Instead, they use a unique fertilizer sourced from seaweed collected from a nearby lagoon. This seaweed is believed to contribute to the special flavor of the vegetables grown here.

## ****Overview****
Located just south of Da Nang, Vietnam, the Marble Mountains are a cluster of five limestone hills, each named after the five natural elements: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Over time, geological changes and sediment buildup gradually connected these once-isolated islands to the mainland, creating the unique landscape we see today.
## 1. Water Mountain (Thuy Son)
Water Mountain, or Thuy Son in Vietnamese, is the largest and most famous of the five Marble Mountains. This mountain is home to ancient temples and stunning caves. Some must-visit places here include: Am Phu Cave, Tang Chon Cave, Van Thong Cave, Huyen Khong Cave, Linh Ung Pagoda, Tam Thai Pagoda, and Heaven Gate.
### Am Phu Cave
The entrance to Am Phu Cave—dark and mysterious.
Am Phu Cave is located near the base, next to the elevator. Its name, ‘Am Phu,’ translates to ‘hell’ in Vietnamese, and inside, you’ll find eerie carvings depicting the journey to the afterlife.
### Linh Ung Pagoda
Linh Ung Pagoda – a spiritual gem in the Marble Mountains
At the foot of the mountain, you’ll climb 108 steps to reach Linh Ung Pagoda, a 200-year-old sacred site. This pagoda is a place where both locals and visitors come to pray for good fortune. In front of the temple, you’ll find a serene garden filled with colorful flowers, bonsai trees, dragon sculptures, and an impressive large Buddha statue.
Did you know that Da Nang is home to three pagodas with the same name, Linh Ung? One is on Son Tra Peninsula, another on Ba Na Hills, and the third is right here on this mountain. If you’re interested in exploring Linh Ung Pagoda on Son Tra Peninsula, check out our comprehensive guide at the link below!

### Tang Chon Cave
Inside Tang Chon Cave
Tang Chon Cave is located behind Linh Ung Pagoda, accessible through natural stone gateways. Inside, you’ll find smaller chambers, each housing intricately carved statues. Notably, some of these sculptures date back to the 10th century and are remnants of the ancient Cham culture
### Van Thong Cave
Van Thong Cave
After exploring Tang Chon Cave, you’ll reach Van Thong Cave. This cave is quite small and has some very narrow passages—so tight that only one person can squeeze through at a time. The path inside is steep and can be a bit of a challenge, but once you make it through, you’ll step into a peaceful open space with lovely views.
### Huyen Khong Cave
Huyen Khong Cave
Huyen Khong Cave is often considered the most beautiful cave on this mountain. As you step inside, the first thing you’ll notice is a large Buddha statue sitting right across from the entrance. Sunlight streams in through an opening at the top, casting a soft, almost mystical glow over the cave. You’ll also find several shrines where visitors come to pray. During wartime, this cave served as a hiding place for soldiers.
### Tam Thai Pagoda
Tam Thai Pagoda
Leaving Huyen Khong Cave, make your way to Tam Thai Pagoda, a historic temple dating back to the 17th century. This small yet charming pagoda showcases traditional Vietnamese Buddhist architecture and was once honored as a national temple by the king. The peaceful atmosphere here is truly special—you can hear the soft chime of temple bells, adding to the serenity of the space.
### Heaven Gate
Linh Ung Pagoda – a spiritual gem in the Marble Mountains
Our final stop on this journey is Heaven Gate. To get there, you’ll follow a narrow path with stone steps, then climb over a short stretch of rugged rocks. But once you reach the top, it’s all worth it—the view stretches out to the coastline, and you can take in the fresh, cool breeze.
## 2. Metal Mountain (Kim Son)
Metal Mountain and its beautiful sights.
Kim Son Mountain has a distinctive bell-shaped form and is home to the well-known Quan Am Pagoda. One of its highlights is Quan Am Cave, a 70-meter-long cavern filled with fascinating rock formations. As you make your way through, you’ll see unique stalactites and stalagmites, each with its mysterious shape. At the very end of the cave, there’s a serene, crystal-clear pool of water.
## 3. Fire Mountain (Hoa Son)
Fire Mountain and its beautiful sights.
Fire Mountain sits next to Metal Mountain, right along the banks of the Co Co River. This mountain is home to Linh Son Pagoda, a peaceful temple. One of its main highlights is Huyen Vi Cave, a spacious and beautiful cavern.
## 4. Wood Mountain (Moc Son)
Wood Mountain
Unlike the other Marble Mountains, Wood Mountain has no temples or caves—just towering rock formations. Below, the local stone-carving village keeps ancient craftsmanship alive.
## 5. Earth Mountain (Tho Son)
Earth Mountain and its beautiful sights.
Earth Mountain is the lowest of the five Marble Mountains. At its base, you’ll find some small pagodas.
## Which Marble Mountains are worth visiting? Here’s our honest advice
If you’re visiting the Marble Mountains, Water Mountain is the one you don’t want to miss. It’s the largest and most scenic of the five, packed with fascinating caves, temples, and beautiful viewpoints. We highly recommend starting your adventure here!
If you have extra time and want to explore further, head over to Metal and Fire Mountain. These two mountains sit next to each other and feature some hidden caves and beautiful pagodas worth checking out.

## White vs red dragon fruit: Appearance tips
_A visual comparison of white (left) and red (right) dragon fruit. Shape and bract direction are helpful clues for telling the difference before you cut into them_
### **Shape and size**
Red-fleshed [dragon fruit](https://vivavn.com/dragon-fruit/) tends to be more round, almost globe-like, while white-fleshed varieties are usually longer and more oval-shaped. In other words, if the fruit looks shorter and stubbier, it’s more likely to be red inside.
### **Color of the skin**
The skin of the red variety is often a brighter, more vivid pink or red, compared to the paler or duller tone of the white-fleshed kind. However, this isn’t always a reliable indicator, since growing conditions can influence the skin color.
**Note:**
While the photo above makes the color difference between white and red dragon fruit look obvious, that’s not always the case in real life. Skin color can vary depending on growing conditions, so it’s best not to rely on color alone when trying to tell them apart.
### **The “fins” or bracts**
Take a closer look at the green-tipped scales (often called “fins” or “ears”) that stick out from the skin. This is where experienced growers often find the most telling clue:
On white-fleshed dragon fruit, the fins are usually straighter and more upright.
On red-fleshed dragon fruit, the fins tend to curl or bend backward more dramatically.
**Look at the bracts**
It’s a subtle difference, but many farmers consider this one of the most reliable visual signs—especially when skin color is too similar to judge.
### **Weight**
Red dragon fruit is generally denser and heavier than white dragon fruit of the same size. Pick one of each up in your hand—you might feel the difference.
## Taste and texture compared
White dragon fruit tastes mildly sweet with a gentle tang, making it light and refreshing. The red variety, on the other hand, tends to be richer, with a deeper sweetness. Interestingly, neither type gives off much aroma when ripe, so don’t expect a strong fruity smell like you might get from [tropical fruits](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/) such as mango or jackfruit.
Both types have soft, hydrating flesh speckled with tiny edible black seeds. The red variety is often a bit more delicate and juicy, making it great for smoothies or spoon-eating. The white kind holds its shape better when sliced, which makes it a popular choice for fruit platters or salads.

## Health benefits and nutrition
### **Low in calories, high in fiber**
Both red and white dragon fruit are naturally low in calories—about 57 calories per 100 grams—and provide roughly 3.1 grams of dietary fiber. That makes them a great option for supporting healthy digestion and weight management.
### **Hydrating and refreshing**
With high water content—about **84%** , according to USDA data—both red and white dragon fruit help keep you hydrated, especially in hot weather. They’re a refreshing fruit choice during summer or after exercise.
### **Antioxidants in red dragon fruit**
Red dragon fruit is rich in antioxidants, particularly [betalains](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35265960/) — the pigments responsible for its vibrant magenta flesh. These powerful compounds may help reduce inflammation and protect your cells from oxidative stress. Read the full 2021 scientific review on betalains in _Molecules_ [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8123435/#sec5-molecules-26-02520).
If you’re curious about the exact nutrition values, here’s a quick breakdown based on a 100g serving. For the full details, you can check the official USDA database [here](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2344729/nutrients).
**Nutrient** | **Amount** | **Notes**  
---|---|---  
**Water** | 83.96 | Helps keep the body hydrated.  
**Calories** | 57 kcal | A very light, low-calorie fruit.  
**Fiber** | 3.1 g | Good for digestion and gut health.  
**Carbohydrates** | 15.23 g | Provides natural energy with a mild sweetness.  
**Vitamin C** | 4.3 mg | Supports the immune system.  
**Potassium** | 116 mg | Helps maintain fluid balance and muscle function.  
**Calcium** | 9 mg | May support bone and teeth health.  
**Iron** | 0.18 mg | Contributes to red blood cell function.  
**Magnesium** | 7 mg | Involved in muscle and nerve function.  
## **So, which dragon fruit is better?**
It really comes down to what you’re looking for.
**If you prefer a fruit that’s light, crisp, and subtly sweet** , white dragon fruit is your go-to. It’s less intense in flavor, holds its shape well when sliced, and works beautifully in fruit salads or as a cooling summer snack.
**If you want something bolder, sweeter, and a little juicier** , red dragon fruit might be the better pick. Its vibrant magenta flesh makes smoothies pop with color, and it’s often favored for its slightly richer taste and higher antioxidant content.
That said, if you’re being mindful of sugar intake—for example, due to dietary goals or medical advice—it may be worth noting that the red variety tends to taste sweeter. As always, your personal needs and preferences should guide the best choice for you.
## FAQs about white and red dragon fruit
### How can you tell white and red dragon fruit apart before cutting?
Red dragon fruit is usually rounder with more curled fins (bracts), while white ones tend to be longer with straighter fins. Skin color can help—red varieties often appear brighter or more vivid. Another clue: at the same size, red dragon fruit typically feels heavier than white, due to its denser, juicier flesh.
### Is red dragon fruit always sweeter than white?
Generally, yes. Red-fleshed varieties tend to have a deeper, richer sweetness. However, exact taste can vary based on how ripe the fruit is and where it was grown.
### Are the seeds edible?
Yes, the small black seeds in both types are edible.

# What is OCOP? Vietnam’s One Commune, One Product Program
We will help you better understand the OCOP program in Vietnam.

_In recent years, the OCOP program has had a strong impact in Vietnam, raising the income of rural people. In this article, let’s learn about this program._
## Introduction
A product certified to meet OCOP standards
OCOP is a Vietnamese government program that aims to promote the development of local products. The program was launched in 2018 and is based on the idea of “One Commune One Product.” This means that each commune (a small administrative unit in Vietnam) is encouraged to develop and promote a single product that is unique to its locality.
## Empowering local products
The OCOP program aims to develop and enhance the value and quality of one signature product from each commune in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam). This is achieved by leveraging local resources, traditional knowledge, and production techniques, while also improving production processes
## The benefits of Vietnam’s OCOP program
**Enhancing local incomes:** By promoting the production of regional specialties, OCOP helps locals generate a stable income from selling their products.
**Empowering consumers with quality products:** The OCOP program provides an excellent opportunity for consumers to experience and access high-quality specialties and products from different regions.
**Building local brand and image:** OCOP products are not just commodities, but also the core of an interesting story and image of that locality, thereby creating a strong brand and introducing the unique culture of that place to the world.
**Promoting tourism and local economic development:** OCOP products are often closely tied to local identity, which attracts tourists to new lands, increases economic resources, and creates jobs for the community.
**Improving product quality and production processes:** By participating in the OCOP program, producers need to improve product quality, comply with food safety and hygiene standards, and develop more efficient production processes.
## The OCOP product quality assessment
The OCOP product rating system is a five-star system that assesses the quality and potential of [Vietnamese products](https://vivavn.com/). The system is based on a set of criteria, including product quality and market accessibility to fulfill consumer demands and maximize market potential.
Products are rated on a scale of 1 to 100 points, with 100 being the highest possible score.
Products that score 90 or above are awarded five stars
Products that score 70 to 89 are awarded four stars
Products that score 50 to 69 are awarded three stars
Products that score 30 to 49 are awarded two stars
Products that score below 30 are awarded one star
## How many products have achieved a 5-star OCOP rating in Vietnam?

Hoi An is a city with a population of approximately 120,000 in Vietnam’s Quang Nam Province, registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1999. Old Town Hoi An, the city’s historic district, is recognized as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century, its buildings and street plan reflecting a blend of indigenous and foreign influences. (Wikipedia)  

## Huynh Phuong Do: The Artist and His Craft
Young Huynh Phuong Do
From a young age, Huynh Phuong Do apprenticed under skilled carpenters in Kim Bong woodworking village in Hoi An. He recalls a life-changing moment during the major flood of 1999 in Hoi An when he noticed bamboo roots drifting in front of his door.
Picking them up, he conceived the idea to carve them into sculptures. After days of hard work, he showcased his first pieces to tourists, quickly selling out. Since then, he has been dedicated to crafting sculptures from bamboo roots.
## The Creative Process: Turning Bamboo Roots into Art
Huynh Phuong Do searches for bamboo roots from old, dead bamboo trees
He starts by searching for bamboo roots from old, dead bamboo trees, which he carefully digs up and brings home. Once at home, the bamboo roots undergo traditional processing and preservation methods. First, they are soaked in mud for about 9 months to prepare them. After this, they are cleaned and left to sun-dry for around 10 days to strengthen the roots and prevent mold.
Before creating each piece, he examines and imagines which famous face the bamboo root could resemble best. According to Huynh Phuong Do, the most challenging parts are shaping the eyes and mouth to express emotions like happiness, sadness, joy, or anger accurately. After sculpting the face, he moves on to sanding the sculpture. Surprisingly, he completes each artwork in just about 30 minutes.
Each of his artworks is unique because each bamboo root varies in shape and size. No two pieces are alike, even when depicting the same character.
This work not only gives Huynh Phuong Do a good income to support his family, but it also allows him to teach many young artisans this craft, helping them earn a living too.

## More to Know
Huynh Phuong Do’s shop in the ancient town of Hoi An is a favorite spot for visitors. Tourists love watching him work, amazed at how he turns bamboo roots into beautiful sculptures. Many also buy his creations as special souvenirs, taking home a piece of Hoi An’s art.
He plans to open workshops in Hoi An’s ancient town, where tourists can engage with and learn about this unique craft. Participants will be able to take their creations home after the workshops.
## Final Thoughts
Bamboo roots used to be considered worthless, often thrown away or used as firewood by poor families. However, Huynh Phuong Do, with his talent, has transformed these roots into beautiful works of art. This shows how creativity can turn the ordinary into the extraordinary.

_Using eco-friendly products is a growing consumer trend worldwide. In Hue City, Vietnam, there’s a village where residents have been making household items from bamboo for centuries, and their products are highly favored by consumers._
## Introduction
Bao La Village is a small village located about 15 kilometers north of Hue City in Vietnam. The village is home to about 300 households, and in addition to farming, the people of Bao La Village also have a traditional handicraft: making bamboo products for sale. Initially sold locally, Bao La’s goods are now recognized internationally for their attractive designs and durability.
## History
Over 600 years ago, settlers from the northern part of Vietnam established Bao La village. They brought with them the traditional bamboo weaving craft, which they used to make a variety of items for their daily use, such as bamboo baskets and tools for fishing that could be sold to trade for food.
Over time, the bamboo weaving tradition was passed down from generation to generation. Today, most villagers in Bao La know how to weave bamboo. This is why the tradition has been preserved to this day.
## Challenges and preservation efforts
In the past, after each harvest season, the villagers of Bao La would turn to bamboo weaving to earn extra income.
However, in the 1980s and 1990s, the introduction of plastic household goods had a devastating impact on the bamboo weaving industry. These new products were cheaper and more versatile, and the traditional bamboo products from Bao La could not compete. As a result, the villagers’ income plummeted, and many were forced to abandon the craft altogether.
Not until 2007, after tireless efforts from the villagers and local organizations, did the Bao La bamboo weaving industry gradually revive. This revival was driven by a combination of factors, including:
**A renewed appreciation for eco-friendly products:**
As consumers became more aware of the environmental impact of plastic, there was a growing demand for natural alternatives like bamboo products.
**Efforts to modernize and diversify products:**
The villagers adapted their traditional techniques to create products that appealed to modern consumers, such as stylish furniture and home decor items.
**Support for marketing and promotion:**
Local initiatives and collaborations helped raise awareness of Bao La’s bamboo products and connect them with a wider market.
## How artisans in the village of Bao La weave bamboo into items.
The people of Bao La village use traditional methods and tools to weave bamboo items. Depending on the complexity of the piece, it can take a craftsman anywhere from a few hours to several days to complete it.
### Step 1: Select the local bamboo
Crafting a bamboo product starts by picking the right bamboo. Skilled artisans don’t just choose any bamboo; they look for stalks that meet certain standards. The best bamboo is usually at least two years old and quite tall, often over 10 meters. It needs to be straight to make strong and good-looking products. Also, it’s best to harvest bamboo during the dry season to avoid problems caused by moisture.
### Step 2: Prepare the bamboo
After selecting the bamboo, it is time to prepare it for weaving. This involves cutting the bamboo to the right size and shape and then removing the nodes. The bamboo is then dried in the sun to remove any moisture.
### Step 3: Split the bamboo into strips
The bamboo is split into strips using a sharp knife. The size and length of the strips will depend on the specific product being made.
### Step 4: Weaving the product
The weaving process requires skill and patience. Depending on the complexity, the product can be completed in a few hours or it can take several days.
### Step 5: Finishing the product
This step involves painting and drying the finished product for beauty and protection. This ensures the creation can be enjoyed for years to come.
## The bamboo weaving products of Bao La village
The bamboo weaving products of Bao La village showcase over 500 different designs, including best-sellers like baskets, decorative lamps, tea trays, and furniture. These products are highly regarded for their beautiful designs and durability.
## Why bamboo products are eco-friendly
### Renewable Resource
Bamboo can regenerate. When you cut the bamboo stalk, new shoots can grow from the root system. Bamboo only takes 2-5 years to grow large enough for harvesting, making it a highly renewable resource.
### Low Maintenance
Bamboo plants do not require fertilizers or pesticides to thrive. This means that growing bamboo has a minimal impact on the environment.
### Biodegradable
Bamboo products are naturally biodegradable. When disposed of, they break down without harming the environment, unlike many synthetic materials that can take hundreds of years to decompose.
## Final Thoughts
For nearly 600 years, the villagers of Bao La Village have preserved their craft despite numerous challenges. As awareness grows about the importance of using eco-friendly products instead of plastic, Bao La’s bamboo items have become increasingly popular. The story of Bao La bamboo weaving village reminds us that within our hands lies the ability to create a life that is both beautiful and sustainable.

# Mi Quang (Quang noodles): What You Should Know About This Dish

_In this article, we’ll explore Mi Quang, a delicious noodle dish from Vietnam. Discover the key ingredients, learn how to prepare it, and find out the best ways to enjoy this flavorful meal._
Ingredients
How to make Mi Quang
How to enjoy Mi Quang
We’ll share the recipe for Mi Quang ga (Quang noodles with chicken), which is the most popular version. That said, you can also find other delicious variations made with different meats like beef, fish, frog, or pork.
## Ingredients
### For the Soup:
Quang noodles
Chicken breast fillets (thinly sliced)
Quail eggs
Chicken broth
Shallots (finely chopped)
Turmeric powder (for flavor and color)
Fish sauce
Cooking oil
### Seasonings:
Seasoning powder
Sugar
Black pepper
Chili powder
### Fresh Vegetables (served on the side):
Lettuce leaves
Fresh herbs (such as basil, mint, cilantro)
Lime wedges
Sliced fresh chili peppers
Banana blossom (optional, finely sliced)
### Toppings:
Banh trang me (Crispy rice crackers with sesame)
Roasted peanuts
## How to make Mi Quang
Start by marinating the chicken in a mixture of two-thirds of the turmeric powder, half of the shallots, minced garlic, [fish sauce](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fish-sauce/), and salt. Let it soak up those flavors while you prepare the rest.
Next, heat a pan over medium heat and add some oil. Toss in the remaining shallots and sauté them until they become fragrant and slightly golden. Then, add the marinated chicken to the pan. Stir everything together. Sprinkle in the remaining turmeric and mix well. Once the chicken is cooked through, pour in the chicken broth and let it simmer until the flavors meld together. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed, then turn off the heat.
To serve, place some Mi Quang noodles in a bowl, top it with the cooked chicken and quail eggs, and ladle in the broth. Finish it off with a sprinkle of crushed peanuts, chopped scallions, and a crispy Bánh tráng mè on the side for that perfect crunch.
## How to enjoy Mi Quang
To eat Mi Quang, add fresh herbs and crispy Bánh tráng to the bowl and mix them in. A squeeze of lime juice gives it a nice flavor. If you like, you can also pour some dipping sauce (made from fish sauce and chili) over it for extra taste. Then, enjoy every bite!

Key differences
Which one should you try first?
FAQs
## What is pho?
Pho is a fragrant noodle soup that originated in Northern Vietnam but has become a favorite throughout the country and internationally. Typically, Pho is made with either beef (pho bo) or chicken (pho ga), accompanied by a savory broth that is infused with [herbs](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/) and spices like star anise and cinnamon.
### Key ingredients of pho:
**Broth:** Clear, light, and aromatic with flavors of cinnamon, cloves, and star anise. It has a mild, subtly sweet taste.
**Noodles:** Soft Flat rice noodles.
**Toppings:** Sliced beef or chicken, fresh herbs (such as Thai basil), lime, bean sprouts, and some optional seasonings.
## What is bun bo Hue?
Bun bo Hue hails from the central region of Vietnam, specifically Hue, and is known for its bold, spicy flavors. Unlike pho, which has a more delicate taste, un bo Hue is rich in spices, often spicier, and comes with a more robust, savory broth.
### Key ingredients of bun bo Hue:
**Broth:** Rich, spicy, and savory, flavored with lemongrass, shrimp paste, and chili. The broth is often darker and more intense than Pho’s.
**Noodles:** Round rice noodles.
**Toppings:** Includes a combination of beef, Vietnamese sausage, and pig’s blood cubes. Pork hock is often added for extra richness.
## **Key differences between Pho and Bun Bo Hue**
### Origin
Pho comes from northern Vietnam, where the food is known for its light and mild flavors. Bun bo Hue, on the other hand, is from Hue, the ancient capital of central Vietnam. The food in this region is famous for being bold and spicy, which is why Bun Bo Hue has a stronger, spicier taste. These regional differences give Pho and bun bo Hue their unique flavors.
### Broth
If you take a closer look at the ingredients used to make the broths for pho and bun bo Hue, you’ll see how they shape the unique flavors of each dish. Bun Bo Hue is known for its bold, rich flavor, thanks to the use of a distinctive seasoning—fermented shrimp paste—and the fragrant aroma of lemongrass. On the other hand, Pho has a more subtle and comforting taste, infused with the warm spices of cinnamon, star anise, and cloves, commonly found in the cuisines of many countries.
### Noodles
Bun and pho are both made from rice, but they differ in shape – bun is round, while pho is wide and flat.
### Toppings
Pho is typically served with either beef or chicken, often accompanied by optional meatballs and fresh herbs. On the other hand, bun bo Hue features a variety of toppings, including beef, pork, congealed pork blood, Vietnamese sausage, pork hock, and fresh herbs.
### Herbs on the side
Pho is often served with side herbs like [Thai basil](https://vivavn.com/thai-basil/), cilantro, bean sprouts, and lime, while bun bo Hue comes with accompaniments such as fresh herbs, shredded banana blossoms, bean sprouts, and limes.
### Visual appeal
Pho offers a simpler, cleaner presentation with a clear broth and minimal toppings, while bun bo Hue is vibrant and colorful, with red chili oil floating on the broth.
## Pho vs bun bo Hue: Which one should you try first?
If you’re new to Vietnamese cuisine, we’d recommend starting with Pho. Its mild and balanced flavor is something most visitors from any country can enjoy, which is probably why it’s so popular worldwide.

#### Lemon basil seeds
After the delicate white flowers of the lemon basil plant fade, tiny seed pods begin to form along the stems. At first, the seeds inside are soft and milky in color, but as they mature, they gradually turn black—a clear sign they’re ready for harvesting. Like many [Vietnamese herbs](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/), lemon basil seeds are carefully collected and stored for the next planting season, continuing the life cycle of this fragrant herb

**Understanding Lemon Basil Seeds:**
When soaked in water, lemon basil seeds form a soft, jelly-like layer around each seed. This gentle texture makes them a simple addition to light, refreshing drinks, often enjoyed on warm days in Vietnam.
#### Aroma and flavor
Lemon basil leaves and stems have a refreshing, citrusy aroma that’s soothing and slightly reminiscent of fresh lemongrass and lemons. If you pick a leaf and taste it, you’ll notice a delicate sweetness with a hint of tangy sourness, followed by a cool, minty warmth and subtle peppery notes that linger pleasantly on your tongue.
## Growing and harvesting lemon basil in Vietnam
_Healthy rows of lemon basil flourishing in a sunny Vietnamese garden._
#### Growing
Lemon basil thrives in warm, sunny climates like Vietnam, where long days of sunshine help the plants grow strong and flavorful. It grows well in full sun or partial shade, especially during the hottest part of the day. While it loves the warmth, regular watering—typically twice a day in the morning and late afternoon—is essential to keep the soil moist and the plants healthy.
For the best results, lemon basil should be planted in rich, well-draining soil that’s light and airy, allowing the roots to breathe and grow without becoming waterlogged.
Similar to [Thai basil](https://vivavn.com/thai-basil/), lemon basil is often grown from seeds in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam). Once the young seedlings are about 15 days old, farmers carefully transplant them to a new growing area. The plants are spaced about 10 to 15 centimeters apart to give them enough room to grow strong and healthy.

_Rich, loose soil with good drainage helps lemon basil grow strong_
#### Harvesting
In Vietnam, farmers usually begin harvesting lemon basil around 30 days after planting. Using a small knife, they carefully trim the upper portions of the plants, which encourages new shoots to grow. This method allows the plants to continue developing, providing multiple harvests over time.

##  **Culinary uses of lemon basil** in Vietnam
### Lemon basil seed drink
Lemon basil seed drink is a refreshing, lightly sweetened beverage made with water, sugar, ginger, and basil seeds. It’s often served chilled and garnished with a slice of lime and fresh mint leaves. Light, aromatic, and soothing, this drink is perfect for warm days when you’re looking for something naturally uplifting.

### Chicken hotpot with lemon basil leaves
The hotpot features tender chicken simmered with aromatic ingredients like [fish sauce](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fish-sauce/), garlic, and shallots, creating a rich and flavorful broth. When it’s time to eat, diners place rice noodles in their bowls, ladle in the hot broth and chicken, then add a handful of fresh lemon basil leaves. The heat from the broth gently softens the leaves, releasing their bright, citrusy aroma.
## Frequently asked questions about lemon basil
### Is lemon basil the same as Thai basil?
No, they’re different herbs. While both belong to the basil family, lemon basil has a refreshing citrus aroma with subtle tangy notes, while Thai basil has a stronger, spicy-sweet flavor with hints of licorice. They’re used in different Vietnamese dishes based on the flavor profile needed.
### How long does it take for lemon basil to grow before harvesting?
In Vietnam’s tropical climate, lemon basil can be harvested about 30 days after planting. Farmers often trim the upper leaves, allowing the plants to regrow and provide multiple harvests.
### Can I grow lemon basil at home?
Absolutely! Lemon basil grows well in warm, sunny spots with well-draining soil. Just be sure to water regularly. You’ll enjoy the refreshing scent right from your own garden!

## What is dragon fruit?
Image: VITA MARKET
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** thanh long 
**Shape and appearance:** oval or elliptical with vibrant pink or yellow skin and green, scale-like leaves. The inside is white or red with black seeds.
**Flavor profile:** mildly sweet and tangy, with a refreshing and slightly crunchy texture.
**How to enjoy it:** enjoy it fresh, in fruit salads, smoothies, desserts, or as juice.
**Harvest season:** In Vietnam, dragon fruit is harvested 3-4 times a year, with the main harvest season stretching from April to October.
Dragon fruit, scientifically known as _Hylocereus_ , comes from a cactus species that originates in Mexico. It gets its name due to its unique appearance, which resembles the scales of a dragon.
The French introduced this plant to Vietnam over a century ago. What started as a small cultivation effort on a few plantations has grown significantly. By the 1980s, dragon fruit farming boomed in Vietnam, turning the country into a global leader in both dragon fruit production and export.
Dragon fruit plants are incredibly resilient to drought, making them well-suited for hot, sunny climates. However, they can’t handle the cold and thrive best in areas with strong sunlight. If planted in the shade, these plants won’t grow well and may not even produce flowers.
In Vietnam, dragon fruit is harvested 3-4 times a year, with the main harvest season stretching from April to October.
### Shape and color
When the fruit is young, it starts off green, but as it ripens, it takes on an oval shape with bright pink or yellow skin adorned with green scales. Inside, the flesh can be either red or white, dotted with tiny black seeds.

## What does dragon fruit taste like?
Image: VITA MARKET
When dragon fruit is still unripe, its flesh can be quite firm and doesn’t have much flavor. However, once it’s fully ripe, it transforms into a flavor that’s like a mild blend of kiwi and pear. The juicy, tender flesh then offers a gentle sweetness that’s both refreshing and delicate.
## How to eat Vietnamese dragon fruit
Check out our video below for a step-by-step guide on how to cut dragon fruit perfectly. We’ll show you how to handle this exotic fruit with ease, so you can enjoy its vibrant flavor in no time!
To fully enjoy the delicious flavor of Vietnamese dragon fruit, start by choosing a ripe fruit. The simplest way to check if it’s ripe is to press it with your fingers gently. It should feel slightly soft, like a ripe avocado. If it feels very firm, it may not be ripe yet.
**Step 1:** Slice off both ends of the dragon fruit
**Step 2:** Cut the fruit lengthwise
**Step 3:** Peel the skin with your fingers or scoop out the flesh using a spoon
**Step 4:** Cut it into bite-sized pieces
**Finally:** Enjoy the sweet, refreshing taste of your Vietnamese dragon fruit!
## The different varieties of Vietnamese dragon fruit
### Vietnamese white dragon fruit
Image: VITA MARKET
### Vietnamese red dragon fruit
Image: VITA MARKET
Both red-fleshed and white-fleshed dragon fruits are packed with health benefits, but they have a few differences worth noting. Red-fleshed dragon fruit is richer in antioxidants compared to its white-fleshed counterpart. It’s also sweeter due to its higher sugar content. Because of this, nutrition experts often recommend white-fleshed dragon fruit for people with diabetes.
### Yellow-skinned dragon fruit
Image: VITA MARKET
Yellow dragon fruit is grown in Vietnam, but it’s not as common as the red or white varieties. This type of dragon fruit is more challenging to cultivate, which is why it’s only grown in smaller quantities. You’ll find it scattered around areas like Binh Thuan and the Mekong Delta,
## Nutritional facts of dragon fruit
Here’s the nutritional breakdown for a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of dragon fruit, based on data from the **[USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2344729/nutrients)** :

You can find more details about the research [**here**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9861186/).
## How dragon fruit is cultivated in Vietnam
While dragon fruit can be grown from seeds, this method takes a lot longer to produce fruit. In Vietnam, farmers often use a more efficient method by planting dragon fruit from cuttings taken from the parent plant. This is a form of asexual reproduction, where healthy cuttings from a mature dragon fruit plant are sliced off and planted directly in the soil.
This approach offers several benefits. It allows the new plants to inherit all the desirable traits of the parent plant, including its growth rate, disease resistance, and fruit quality. By using cuttings, farmers can enjoy quicker harvests and ensure consistent fruit quality.
Typically, after planting, dragon fruit plants start producing fruit within a year. By their third or fourth year, they reach their peak productivity. With proper care, dragon fruit plants can have a lifespan of 15 to 20 years.
Dragon fruit plants need support poles to grow properly because they are a type of climbing cactus that can’t stand upright on their own. Farmers often use poles for the plants to climb and wrap around.
These poles are usually made of concrete, wood, or other sturdy materials and are typically between 4 to 4.5 feet tall (about 1.3 to 1.4 meters).
**Did you know?**
In Vietnam, dragon fruit farmers use a clever trick to boost their harvests. Since dragon fruit plants thrive in sunlight, they light up the fields at night with artificial lamps. This extra light helps the plants flower and fruit more abundantly, ultimately increasing the yield.

**Pack hiking essentials:** To spot rare bird species, you may need to spend an entire day in the forest. Along with your camera and lenses, be sure to bring appropriate hiking attire, a tent, and insect repellent.
**Head to the Son Tra Nature Reserve.** This is the best place to spot birds on the peninsula. The reserve is home to a variety of habitats, including forests, mountains, and lakes, which attract a wide variety of birds.
**Bring binoculars and a bird identification guide.** A good pair of binoculars will help you see the birds up close, and a bird identification guide will help you identify the species you see.
**Be quiet and patient** : Birds are easily scared, so it’s important to be quiet and patient when birdwatching. Move slowly and avoid making loud noises.
To capture beautiful moments of birds, birdwatchers must camouflage carefully and remain still in one spot for many hours. (Photographer: Huy Dope)

# Chung Cake (Banh Chung): A Tasty Dish on Vietnamese Tet (Lunar New Year)
How the Vietnamese make it and the typical ways of enjoying chung cake

_Chung cake (Banh Chung) is an indispensable dish in every Vietnamese family during[**Tet (Lunar New Year)**](https://vivavn.com/what-is-tet/). In this article, let’s explore comprehensively about this dish, from its origins to the traditional process of how Vietnamese people make Chung cake and how to eat them._
## Introduction
Image: VITA MARKET
Chung cake is a time-honored traditional cake in Vietnam, crafted from ingredients like glutinous rice, mung beans, pork, and dong leaves (or banana leaves). The cake is created by combining these ingredients, wrapping them in a square shape with Dong leaves, and then boiling them for approximately half a day.
For the Vietnamese, making Chung cake during Tet is a longstanding tradition that dates back centuries. In the final days of the year, family members come together to create these cakes.
Then they stay up through the night near the pot of boiling Chung cake, reminiscing about family memories and sharing stories of the past year. Once the Chung cake is fully cooked, it is placed on the ancestral altar as a gesture of respect and gratitude toward the ancestors.
## The origins of Chung cake
The legend recounts that Chung cake has its roots in the time of the Sixth Hung King. It is said that after successfully defeating the An invaders, during the first days of the new year, the King aimed to pass the throne to one of his princes.
To determine the successor, the King gathered his sons and declared that the one who presented a delicious dish with significance to their ancestors would inherit the throne. The princes eagerly sought various rare and precious ingredients to offer their father. Among them, only Prince Lang Lieu, the eighteenth prince, kind and dutiful but without a mother for a long time, was uncertain about his choice.
One night, Lang Lieu dreamt of a deity guiding him: ‘Nothing in the world is as precious as [rice grains](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-organic-rice/), the sustenance of human life. Mold rice into round and square shapes, symbolizing Earth and Heaven. Wrap them with leaves and place the filling inside to symbolize the grace of childbirth from parents.’ When Lang Lieu presented the dish to the King, he was delighted to discover the tasty and meaningful Chung cake. Consequently, the King passed the throne to Lang Liêu. The origin of Chung cake and [Giay cake](https://vivavn.com/what-is-giay-cake/) can be traced back to this legend.
## Ingredients and making process
### Key components of Chung cake
The ingredients for making Chung cake are purchased from local markets or supermarkets. To make Chung cake, we need the following ingredients:
[Glutinous rice](https://vivavn.com/what-is-glutinous-rice/)
Mung beans
Pork belly
Spices: salt, sliced shallots, pepper, etc.
[Dong leaves](https://vivavn.com/what-is-dong-leaf/) (or Banana leaves)
Thin [bamboo ](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-bamboo/)strips
### How to make Chung cake?
#### Step 1: Prepare the cake filling and the leaves for wrapping the cake
Wash the Dong leaves thoroughly with water.
Soak glutinous rice and mung beans for about four hours or overnight to ensure that Chung cakes are soft and aromatic.
#### Step 2: Preliminarily prepare food
Place the glutinous rice in a basket, allow it to drain, and then mix the rice thoroughly with a small amount of salt.
Similarly, we drain water from the green beans after pouring them out and then mix them with salt.
Chop the pork belly into squares and marinate them with salt, sliced shallots, and pepper for a few hours.
#### Step 3: Wrap the cake

Using a mold makes the process of wrapping the cake easier and ensures that the cake has an attractive square shape.
Arrange 4 or 5 Dong leaves in the mold, then layer the ingredients in sequence, beginning with glutinous rice, followed by mung beans. Place a couple of pork belly pieces in the middle, add another layer of mung beans, and finish with a layer of glutinous rice. Fold the Dong leaves and securely tie the cake using two thin bamboo strips.
#### Step 4: Boiling Chung cake
Image: VITA MARKET
To begin, put the wrapped Chung cake in a pot, add enough water to fully submerge the cakes, and then heat it to boil. The cooking time depends on the size and quantity of the cakes in the pot. Typically, we boil Chung cake for about half a day. As the water in the pot reduces, be sure to add more water to ensure the cakes remain fully immersed.
## How the Vietnamese enjoy Chung cake
Image: VITA MARKET
### Enjoy Chung cake by dipping it in molasses or sugar.
We place molasses or sugar in a bowl, and cut the Chung cake into bite-sized pieces. Take a piece, dip it into the molasses or sugar, and we savor the rich flavor of the Chung cake blending with the sweetness of the dipping sauce.
### Eat Chung cake with pickled vegetables.
In Central Vietnam, it’s common for people to enjoy Chung cake with pickled vegetables. The delightful blend of sweet and sour flavors from the pickled vegetables enhances the overall enjoyment of the dish.
### Eat Chung cake with pickled small leeks
Pickled small leeks are a traditional Vietnamese dish during Tet, and the perfect combination of Chung cake and pickled small leeks creates a delightful balance that keeps the eater from getting tired of the flavors.
In addition to the traditional way of eating Chung cake, Vietnamese people also fry it and enjoy it.
## The significance of Chung cake during Tet
Image: VITA MARKET
According to an ancient tradition, the square-shaped Chung cake is a symbol representing the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth). The ingredients for making Chung cake include glutinous rice, mung beans, pork, shallots, pepper, and more, all of which are traditional cooking elements in Vietnamese cuisine passed down for thousands of years.
Therefore, the Chung cake on the [Tet](https://vivavn.com/what-is-tet/) carries a significance that expresses gratitude to the heavens and earth for providing favorable weather, resulting in a bountiful harvest and bringing warmth and prosperity to the people’s lives.
Furthermore, during Tet, Chung cake is placed on the ancestral altar as a gesture of respect and gratitude from descendants to their ancestors.
Preparing and cooking Chung cake creates a special moment for family members to gather, reflect on past memories, and reinforce the bonds that bring them together. It offers a significant opportunity for everyone to draw closer and nurture a stronger sense of family connection.

Coconut
__Coconut ranks among the most extensively grown[**plants in Vietnam**](https://vivavn.com/the-most-cultivated-trees-in-vietnam/). In this article, let’s explore interesting facts about Vietnamese coconuts and delicious dishes made from coconuts.__
## Vietnam’s leading coconut-growing regions
The four provinces of Ben Tre, Tra Vinh, Tien Giang, and Binh Dinh have the largest coconut plantations in Vietnam.
Coconuts are grown all over Vietnam, but they are most heavily concentrated in the Mekong Delta region, which makes up 80% of the country’s coconut cultivation area. Here’s a list of the four provinces where coconut cultivation is highest in Vietnam, with three of them situated in the Mekong Delta region.
The Mekong Delta (Vietnamese: Đồng bằng Sông Cửu Long. ’Nine Dragon River Delta’) is the region in southwestern Vietnam where the Mekong River approaches and empties into the sea through a network of distributaries. The Mekong Delta region encompasses a large portion of southwestern Vietnam of over 40,500 km2 (15,600 sq mi). The size of the area covered by water depends on the season. Its wet coastal geography makes it an important source of agriculture and aquaculture for the country. Today, the region comprises 12 provinces: Long An, Dong Thap, Tien Giang, An Giang, Ben Tre, Vinh Long, Tra Vinh, Hau Giang, Kien Giang, Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, and Can Tho.
### Ben Tre
Ben Tre is known as the coconut capital of Vietnam. According to statistics up to May 2023, the province of Bến Tre has a total coconut area of ​​78,195 hectares, accounting for nearly 40% of Vietnam’s coconut area (the whole country has about 200,000 hectares). (Source: **[here](https://baochinhphu.vn/ben-tre-dien-tich-trong-dua-tang-len-hon-78000-ha-102230531103752484.htm)**)
Ben Tre is a province located in the Mekong Delta region, with a natural area of ​​2,360 km². It is situated 86 km from Ho Chi Minh City and 120 km from Can Tho City. To the north, it borders Tien Giang province, while to the west and south it borders Vinh Long province and Tra Vinh province. To the east, it is adjacent to the East Sea.
### Tra Vinh
Tra Vinh ranks as the second-largest province in Vietnam for coconut cultivation, just behind Ben Tre province. As of 2023, Tra Vinh had around 26,000 hectares dedicated to coconut farming. Notably, over 5,000 hectares of this area were managed using organic farming methods. (Source: **[here](https://nongnghiep.vn/tra-vinh-chuan-bi-ky-san-sang-don-co-hoi-xuat-khau-dua-tuoi-d359103.html)**)
Tra Vinh, situated in the Mekong Delta region, covers an area of 2,358 square kilometers and is home to around 1.1 million people. It spans over 65 kilometers along the coastline of the East Sea to the east. To the west, it shares a border with Vinh Long province, while to the south, it neighbors Soc Trang province. To the north, it is adjacent to Ben Tre province.
### Tien Giang
According to Tien Giang Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the total coconut area in the province is 21,654 hectares, ranking third in terms of coconut cultivation area in Vietnam. (Source: **[here](https://tiengiang.gov.vn/chi-tiet-tin?/gia-dua-kho-tang-tro-lai-nong-dan-phan-khoi/53976492)**)
Tien Giang Province, situated in the Mekong Delta region, covers an area of 2,511 square kilometers and had a population of 1.764 million as of 2019. It is bounded by Ho Chi Minh City and the East Sea to the east, Dong Thap Province to the west, and Bến Tre and Vinh Long Provinces to the south. To the north, it shares borders with Long An Province.
### Binh Dinh
Binh Dinh is the fourth-largest province for coconut cultivation in Vietnam, covering approximately 9,300 hectares. Notably, within the South Central region of Vietnam, Binh Dinh boasts the largest coconut cultivation area. (Source: [**here**](https://nongnghiep.vn/cay-dua-tham-lang-lam-giau-d332107.html))
Binh Dinh is a coastal province situated in the northern section of Vietnam’s South Central Coast region. Covering an area of 6,022.6 square kilometers, it is home to a population of 1,487,009 people as of 2021. Binh Dinh shares borders with Gia Lai province to the west, Quang Ngai province to the north, Phu Yen province to the south, and the East Sea to the east.
## Popular types of Vietnamese coconuts
### Favorite kinds of Vietnamese coconuts good for getting fresh water.
#### Green Siamese Coconut (Dua xiem xanh)
Image credit: www.myphuongfood.com
This coconut type is the most commonly grown across the Mekong Delta. On average, a single green Siamese coconut tree produces between 140 and 150 fruits per year. A green Siamese coconut can produce as much as 350 milliliters of water.
#### Dwarf Siamese Coconut (Dua xiem lun)
When fully grown, a dwarf Siamese coconut tree usually stands at around 2 meters tall. These trees bear coconuts with a green hue, though it’s a lighter shade compared to the typical green Siamese coconut. On average, each tree yields 120-150 fruits annually, with each fruit weighing between 1.2 – 1.5 kg. Each coconut can hold 220-280ml of water.
#### Fire Siamese Coconut (Dua xiem lua)
Being a rare and prized coconut variety in Vietnam, it features a reddish-brown shell. Each tree produces between 80 and 140 fruits annually, with each fruit weighing between 1 and 1.2 kg. Additionally, each fruit holds 250-350 ml of water.
### The type of Vietnamese coconut with the best-tasting flesh
#### Coconut sport (Dua sap)
Coconut sport or macapuno is a special delicacy originating from the Mekong Delta province of Tra Vinh. It’s mainly cultivated there by local farmers, who’ve been growing this coconut variety in the province for about 80 years. At first glance, coconut sport appears similar to a regular coconut. However, when fully ripe, it differs significantly. Instead of containing water, the fruit is filled with a white, greasy, jelly-like flesh inside.
### Types of Vietnamese coconuts for oil extraction
In Vietnam, two commonly used coconut varieties for oil extraction are known locally as Dừa Ta and Dừa Dâu. These trees usually reach heights of 10 to 15 meters, boasting thick trunks and a lifespan of around 15 to 30 years. On average, each tree produces 60 to 100 fruits annually. These coconuts are notably large, with thick flesh containing a high oil content of 63-67%.
### Dua nuoc (water coconut)
danviet.vn/ vnexpress.net
The Mekong Delta is famous for its abundant [Mangrove palm ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nypa_fruticans)trees. These trees grow in soft mud and slow-moving tidal and river waters. Vietnamese people call Dua nuoc, which means water coconut. The flesh of the water coconut is deliciously fragrant and nutritious.

### Baked coconut cracker
[**Baked coconut cracker**](https://vivavn.com/topcoco-baked-coconut-cracker/) is a famous dish from the central region of Vietnam. This cake has a special allure with its perfectly balanced sweetness, and distinctive aroma from coconut, [**glutinous rice**](https://vivavn.com/what-is-glutinous-rice/) flour, and other indigenous ingredients. The delicate and crispy texture of the cake will make you fall in love from the very first bite.
The ingredients for baked coconut crackers are all locally sourced, including coconut, glutinous rice flour, sugar, and additional elements like mung beans, peanuts, etc. The meticulous preparation by skilled chefs is aimed at capturing and preserving the rich and delightful taste of coconut in every aspect of the cake.
### Coconut ice cream
Vietnamese coconut ice cream is a delightful dessert, a perfect combination of the delicate flavor of ice cream and the distinctive aroma of coconut. The main ingredients of Vietnamese coconut ice cream include fresh cream, coconut milk, and coconut meat, creating a soft and creamy mixture. On top, one can add crispy dried coconut, peanuts, and sticky rice, etc. A glass of naturally sweet and nutritious coconut water is served alongside the coconut ice cream.
### Vietnamese coconut jelly
Vietnamese coconut jelly is made from coconut water, with its jelly having a translucent, jelly-like texture. Vietnamese coconut jelly is known for its gentle chewiness and mild sweetness, making it a popular addition to sweet soup and bubble tea. The Vietnamese method of making coconut jelly can be summarized as follows:
Fresh coconut water, after being rid of impurities, is mixed with sugar and acetic acid bacteria. The fermentation process by the acid bacteria results in the formation of coconut jelly. The fermentation period can take from several days to a few weeks. When the coconut jelly reaches the desired consistency and thickness, it is cut into square-shaped pieces
### Coconut candy
Coconut candy is a specialty originating from Ben Tre province, Vietnam. The candy is crafted using key ingredients such as coconut meat, sugar, and malt. This type of candy is a distinctive local delicacy and represents a traditional artisanal craft deeply rooted in the cultural heritage of the region.
Creating tasty coconut candy relies heavily on the selection of ingredients. It’s essential to start with high-quality glutinous rice for making malt, ensuring the grains are large and evenly ripened. Before cooking the malt, the rice seeds should be germinated using clean rainwater. Skilled artisans are required to cook the malt properly. Freshly harvested coconuts with golden husks are preferred as they offer a unique flavor, along with sweet coconut water.
### Candied coconut ribbons
Coconut jam is a type of jam made from coconut meat, in which the coconut meat is thinly sliced into strips and mixed with white sugar. Afterward, this mixture is simmered over low heat until the sugar syrup dries up, resulting in coconut jam. During the process, the cook continuously stirs to prevent the coconut jam from sticking or turning [yellow ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow)in color.
Alongside [**Chung cake**](https://vivavn.com/chung-cake/) (banh chung), coconut jam is a traditional Vietnamese delicacy enjoyed during [**Tet holiday**](https://vivavn.com/what-is-tet/).
### Crispy dried coconut
Crispy dried coconut is a topping that Vietnamese people sprinkle onto desserts such as sweet soups, ice cream, and yogurt to enhance their appeal and delicious flavor.

___High in the mountains of Northwest Vietnam, there exists a type of tea known as Shan Tuyet. These ancient tea trees, many of which are centuries old, have gnarled trunks and twisted branches. The tea leaves they produce are covered in a fine white fuzz, which gives them a silvery appearance and a unique flavor.___

## Introduction
The locals pick Shan Tuyet tea (Photo credit: FÌN HÒ TRÀ)
Picture this: women climbing dozens of meters high to harvest tea buds. Pretty impressive, right? Nestled in the **[northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_\(Vietnam\))** mountains of [**Vietnam**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam), you’ll find ranges soaring between 800 to 2,000 meters. With a cool climate and year-round cloud cover, these forests create the perfect home for Shan Tuyet tea trees. These trees can live for centuries and reach heights of 2 to 20 meters, producing premium **[tea](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-tea/)** with a unique flavor.

For generations, Shan Tuyet tea has been a daily beverage for ethnic minority communities in these regions. Because the tea trees grow tall, farmers must climb high branches to harvest the tea buds.
The name “Shan Tuyet” itself reflects the tea’s special characteristics. The delicate white fuzz adorning the tea buds resembles snow clinging to the mountain peaks.
Shan Tuyet tea plants are cultivated completely organically. They are harvested by hand, a delicate process that ensures the white fuzz on the tea buds stays intact.

## History and origin
Vietnam’s provinces renowned for Shan Tuyet tea
No one knows exactly how long Shan Tuyet tea trees have been around. The oldest residents in the region say they have seen these tea trees since they were children. According to research by Vietnamese scientists, the Shan Tuyet tea trees in the mountainous provinces of northwest Vietnam are hundreds of years old.
**Heritage Recognition**
In 2022, 1,324 ancient Shan Tuyet tea trees in the northern province of Ha Giang were recognized as Vietnam heritage trees by the Vietnam Association for Conservation of Nature and Environment, according to the Vietnam News Agency. For further details, see the full article [**here**](https://en.vietnamplus.vn/ancient-shan-tuyet-tea-trees-recognized-as-vietnamese-heritage-tree-post239307.vnp). 
The provinces that grow the most Shan Tuyet tea are Ha Giang, Yen Bai, Son La, and Dien Bien. In the past, local people harvested Shan Tuyet tea for their own use. Today, this tea has become a famous specialty, providing locals with a stable income.
## Cultivation and production
Shan Tuyet tea plants only grow at altitudes between 800 and 2,000 meters above sea level. Remarkably, these tea plants thrive naturally, without the need for fertilizers or pesticides.
Shan Tuyet tea is harvested three to four times a year. The first harvest occurs at the end of March or early April, followed by a second one in May and June. The third harvest takes place in August, and the fourth in October through November.
According to experienced tea pickers, the first harvest—usually in late March and early April during spring—is when the tea yield and quality are at their peak.
To obtain the finest Shan Tuyet tea buds, pickers wake up early and head into the forest. They climb the tall Shan Tuyet tea trees and carefully pick each bud, which is still covered in the morning dew.
Once the leaves are carefully picked, they head to the village for processing. Here too, everything is done by hand. First, the leaves bask in the warm sunshine, drying naturally. Then, they get roasted in a wok over a wood fire. This step requires a skilled touch, as the roaster needs to keep the fire just right to avoid burning the leaves and – most importantly – preserve the precious white fuzz.
## Unique characteristics
Photo credit: FÌN HÒ TRÀ
Shan Tuyet tea offers a slightly bitter taste, a sweet aftertaste, and a gentle, enticing aroma. The tea has an exceptional flavor because it’s grown in the natural environment of the northwestern mountain forests. The clean, cool climate and fertile soil provide essential nutrients.
Also, the tea buds are harvested from centuries-old trees, giving them a unique, delicious taste from years of absorbing nutrients and essence from the environment. Additionally, the meticulous harvesting and processing contribute to its excellent quality.
The distinctions in harvesting and processing methods and the resulting tea color when brewed define the four types of Shan Tuyet tea: Shan Tuyet White Tea, Shan Tuyet Green Tea, Shan Tuyet Yellow Tea, and Shan Tuyet Black Tea.
The four types of Shan Tuyet tea (Photo credit: Không gian văn hoá trà Suối Giàng (Facebook))
**Bach tra (Shan Tuyet White Tea):** Only one bud is picked. It’s naturally fermented, and the tea has a light yellow color.
**Diep tra (Shan Tuyet Green Tea):** One bud and two young leaves are picked. After harvesting, the leaves are immediately pan-roasted. When brewed, the tea has a honey-yellow color.
**Hoang Tra (Shan Tuyet Yellow Tea):** One bud and two leaves, including one mature leaf, are picked. The leaves are allowed to wither before being pan-roasted. The tea has a darker yellow color compared to Shan Tuyet Diep Tea.
**Hong Tra (Shan Tuyet Black Tea):** One bud and two mature leaves are picked. After withering, the leaves are rolled, fermented, and dried without pan-roasting. The tea has a pinkish-red color.
## The health benefits of Shan Tuyet tea
Research by scientists has highlighted the health-promoting properties of Shan Tuyet tea. You can find more information **[here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1934578X221128410?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.4)**. Based on this study, we have summarized the key findings for you.
#### Rich in antioxidants
Shan Tuyet young tea leaves are a valuable source of antioxidants. [**Antioxidants**](https://www.unlockfood.ca/en/Articles/Vitamins-and-Minerals/What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Antioxidants.aspx) are like bodyguards for our cells. They protect us from harmful molecules called free radicals, which can cause serious health problems like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer when they build up in our bodies.
#### EGCG
Shan Tuyet tea is packed with **[EGCG](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32364072/)** , one of the most powerful antioxidants you can find naturally. This EGCG content might help protect against cancer and heart disease. Some studies even suggest it could lower your risk of brain diseases like [**Alzheimer’s**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease) and **[Parkinson’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease)**.
Drinking Shan Tuyet tea not only boosts your mood but also positively impacts your health. It helps combat aging, prevents diabetes, and is good for heart health.

Thai basil FAQs
## What is Thai basil?
Thai basil (_Ocimum basilicum_ var. _thyrsiflora_) is a herb native to Southeast Asia and part of the mint family (_Lamiaceae_). In Vietnam, it’s called _hung que_ and is commonly grown in home gardens throughout the country. With its anise-like scent and subtle hints of licorice, Thai basil stands out among other [Vietnamese herbs](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/), not just for its flavor, but for its aroma as well. This unique taste makes it a beloved addition to a variety of [Vietnamese dishes](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-dishes/), especially _pho_ , Vietnam’s iconic noodle soup.
### Characteristics of Thai basil
#### 1. Thai basil seeds
**Description** : Small, dark seeds approximately 1–2 mm in length, typically found in seed pods formed after the plant flowers. Each pod contains four seeds nestled tightly inside.
**Use** : In Vietnam, Thai basil seeds are sown directly into loose garden soil during the warm season.

#### 2. Thai basil stems
**Description** : Purple-tinted, sturdy stems that become woody at the base with age. The leaves grow in opposite pairs along the stem. Mature Thai basil plants typically reach 30 to 50 cm (12–20 inches) in height.
**Use** : Young, tender stems can be eaten raw or cooked. They are often pinched off with fingers or trimmed using a small knife for continuous harvest. Besides growing from seeds, Thai basil can also be propagated using stem cuttings.

#### 3. Thai basil leaves
**Description** : Medium-green, glossy leaves that are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. The leaves have a distinctive aroma with sweet, anise-like, and mildly spicy notes.
**Use** : Commonly served with pho or as part of a fresh herb platter (_rau song_)—a mix of herbs such as Thai basil, perilla, fish mint, and lettuce—typically enjoyed alongside dishes like _banh xeo_ (Vietnamese pancakes), _bun_ _bo_(beef noodle soup), and _mi Quang_ (Quang noodles).

## Cultivating and harvesting Thai basil in Vietnam
### **1. Optimal growing conditions for Thai basil in Vietnam**

#### Climate & temperature:
Thai basil thrives in a warm, tropical climate, ideally between 24°C and 30°C. Consistent warmth and humidity encourage healthy leaf and flower growth.
#### Sunlight requirements:
For robust growth, Thai basil requires at least 6 hours of full sunlight daily, which is common in Vietnamese gardens.
**Tip:** In very hot climates, plant Thai basil where it gets morning sun and light afternoon shade. This helps prevent heat stress and keeps the plant growing strong.
#### Soil preparation:
Thai basil prefers loose, fertile, and well-draining soils. Vietnamese farmers often enrich their garden beds with compost or organic manure to boost growth.

### **2. How Thai basil is grown by Vietnamese farmers**
In Vietnam, Thai basil is typically grown from seed. Farmers begin by sowing basil seeds directly into loose, well-drained soil. Within about three days, the seeds germinate, sprouting into tiny green shoots. After roughly two weeks, the young plants grow to around 15 cm (6 inches) tall. At this stage, they are densely packed together and need more space to thrive.

So, farmers carefully dig up each seedling and transplant them into new rows with about 20 cm (8 inches) of spacing between each plant. This gives the basil room to grow strong and bushy.

Around 40 days after sowing, the basil is ready for its first harvest. Farmers use small knives to trim the upper stems, leaving the lower part of the plant intact. This method allows the basil to continue growing and produce multiple harvests throughout the season.
With proper care, Thai basil plants in Vietnam can be harvested **five to six times** during a single growing season. Experienced farmers recommend regular watering, plenty of sunlight, and trimming just above the lower leaves to encourage regrowth.

## Health benefits of Thai basil
### **Naturally rich in antioxidants**
Thai basil isn’t just a flavorful herb—it’s naturally rich in antioxidants like chicoric acid, rosmarinic acid, and caffeic acid. [According to recent research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7588007/), these compounds may help protect your cells from oxidative stress, support immune health, and reduce inflammation, factors often linked to chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and even certain types of cancer
### **Essential oils and traditional remedies**
In Vietnam, people extract essential oil from Thai basil’s leaves, stems, and flowers. It’s used in perfumes, cosmetics, and to add flavor to food. The oil’s strong scent also helps repel mosquitoes. Some also use Thai basil in traditional remedies, like making tea to ease coughs.
In Vietnamese folk remedies, Thai basil is used to ease a cough. When symptoms appear, people pick 8 to 10 fresh leaves from the garden, boil them in 300–500ml of water for a few minutes, let it cool, and sip the liquid throughout the day.
## Thai basil in Vietnamese cuisine
###  **Thai basil** in pho (Vietnamese noodle soup)
One of the most iconic ways Thai basil is used in Vietnam is with _pho_ —the beloved noodle soup known for its rich, aromatic broth. When you sit down to enjoy a bowl of pho, it’s usually served with a plate of fresh herbs on the side, and Thai basil is always there. Just a few fresh leaves added on top release a fragrant, slightly spicy aroma that blends beautifully with the savory broth.
### **Thai basil in the fresh herb platter**
In many Vietnamese meals, Thai basil is part of a fresh herb platter called _rau song_. Alongside perilla, lettuce, and fish mint, Thai basil adds a fresh, slightly spicy touch that makes each bite more flavorful.
## Frequently asked questions about Thai basil
### What is Thai basil in Vietnamese?
In Vietnamese, Thai basil is called **“hung que.”** It’s a fragrant herb commonly grown in home gardens and used in Vietnamese cuisine.
### How long does it take to harvest Thai basil for the first time?
In Vietnam, Thai basil is usually ready for its first harvest about 40 days after sowing the seeds. By this time, the plants are well-established, and farmers or gardeners can begin trimming the upper stems, encouraging new growth for future harvests.
### What climate is best for growing Thai basil?
Thai basil thrives in warm, sunny, tropical climates. It loves full sun and well-drained soil. Cold weather and heavy rain can stunt its growth or even cause the plant to die, so it’s best grown during warmer months or in climates that stay consistently warm.
### Can you eat Thai basil stems?
Yes, the young and tender stems of Thai basil are edible and can be used just like the leaves.
### Can Thai basil be grown from cuttings?
Yes! Thai basil can be easily propagated from stem cuttings. With the right soil, moisture, and sunlight, healthy cuttings will develop roots and grow into full plants in just a few weeks.

Vietnamese children learn about bamboo in their earliest lessons. They hear stories of Saint Giong that used bamboo to help the Vietnamese people to defeat their enemies. They learn to make traditional crafts from bamboo, such as baskets, and musical instruments.
## The significance of bamboo in Vietnamese culture
### Construction

In the olden days of rural [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam), bamboo was the go-to material for everything from houses to fences to bridges. This versatile plant was essential to the survival of rural communities, providing them with shelter, security, and a way to cross rivers.
Bamboo houses were cool in the summer and warm in the winter. They were also strong enough to withstand the typhoons that frequently hit Vietnam. Bamboo fences kept livestock in and predators out. And bamboo bridges allowed people to cross rivers safely.

### Household items
Bamboo is a versatile material that is used to make a variety of products in Vietnam. From humble chopsticks to elegant furniture, bamboo is a ubiquitous part of Vietnamese life.
Chopsticks are an essential part of Vietnamese cuisine. They are used to eat everything from rice to noodle. Baskets are another common bamboo product in Vietnam. They are used to carry everything from food to goods. Bamboo chairs are both beautiful and practical. They are lightweight and easy to move.
### Food
Bamboo shoots are a versatile and delicious ingredient that is a staple of Vietnamese cuisine. They can be used in a variety of dishes, from stir-fries to soups. Bamboo shoots have a delicate flavor and a crunchy texture that makes them a unique and enjoyable addition to any meal.
### Symbolism
The Legend of Saint Giong in the Vietnamese textbooks
To the Vietnamese, bamboo is more than just a plant. It is a symbol of resilience, strength, and unity. These qualities are reflected in the many folk stories and legends about bamboo, such as the story of Saint Giong and the story of the Bundle of Chopsticks.
In the story of Saint Giong, a young boy is born to help the Vietnamese people defeat their enemies. The boy grows up to be a giant, and he uses bamboo stalks to defeat the enemy army. This story shows the strength and resilience of bamboo, as well as its importance to the Vietnamese people.
**The story of the Bundle of Chopsticks**
Once upon a time, there were two brothers who were very close. They did everything together and always looked out for each other. However, as they grew older, they began to drift apart. They started to argue and fight, and their relationship became strained.
One day, their father decided to teach them a lesson about the importance of unity. He gathered them together and gave them a bundle of chopsticks. He then told them that each of them would be given a prize if they could break the bundle.
The first brother tried to break the bundle, but he was unable to do so. The second brother tried as well, but he also failed. Finally, the father then took each chopstick out of the bundle and broke it one by one. He did this with ease, demonstrating how weak each individual chopstick was.
Their father then explained to them that the bundle of chopsticks represented their family. Just as the chopsticks were weak when they were separate, so too were they weak when they were divided. However, when they were united, they were strong.
The brothers learned their lesson and vowed to never fight again. They realized that they were stronger together than they were apart.

How to enjoy banh xeo
## What does banh xeo taste like?
Banh Xeo has a nice crunch and a bit of chewiness. It’s made from a crispy rice flour pancake filled with tasty shrimp, pork, and bean sprouts. You can enjoy it with greens like lettuce, mustard greens, Vietnamese coriander, and basil, all dipped in flavorful [Vietnamese fish sauce](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fish-sauce/).
## The key ingredients that make banh xeo delicious
The ingredients can vary slightly depending on the region, but the basics remain the same. The batter is made from rice flour, often mixed with turmeric for that golden color, and coconut milk for a rich flavor. For the filling, you’ll typically find a combination of pork belly, shrimp, bean sprouts, mung beans, and a sprinkle of green onions and shallots. Everything is cooked in a bit of oil until crispy and golden.
Fresh herbs like lettuce, mustard greens, Vietnamese coriander, basil, and perilla are essential for wrapping up each bite in a refreshing burst of flavor. The dipping sauce for banh xeo is a mix of fish sauce, lime juice, chili, and garlic.
## How to make banh xeo
Making banh xeo involves a few simple steps. First, you mix rice flour, turmeric, and coconut milk with water until everything blends smoothly. The turmeric gives the pancake that beautiful yellow color.
Next, you’ll prepare the filling. Shrimp and pork belly are seasoned and stir-fried until cooked through.
To make the pancakes, heat a large pan with a little oil. Once the oil is hot, pour a ladle of the batter into the pan, swirling it around so it forms a thin, round pancake. Cover the pan and let the batter cook for a bit. When it’s partially cooked, add the filling of shrimp, pork belly, bean sprouts, mung beans, and some green onions in the middle. Cover the pan again and cook for a few more seconds until the pancake turns crispy and golden. Then, carefully slide it onto a plate.
## How to enjoy banh xeo
**Prepare Your Ingredients:** When you receive your banh xeo, you’ll usually get a plate of fresh greens and herbs, along with a bowl of dipping sauce (usually a fish sauce blend).
**Wrap It Up:** Take a piece of the crispy pancake and place it on a leaf of lettuce. You can add some fresh herbs for extra flavor.
**Dip and Enjoy:** Dip the wrapped pancake into the sauce and take a big bite! The combination of the crispy pancake, fresh herbs, and tangy sauce is delicious.

## Vietnamese peanuts: A quick introduction
A peanut field in Vietnam during harvest season
Peanuts, known as “lạc” or “đậu phộng” in Vietnamese, thrive in Vietnam’s warm, tropical climate. You’ll find peanut fields scattered across the country, from the northern plains to the southern deltas.
Every year, around April and May, farmers roll up their sleeves and begin the peanut harvest. In the countryside, it’s a familiar and vivid sight — farmers working under the blazing sun, pulling peanut plants from the earth, drying them in the fields, and filling the air with the unmistakable scent of freshly unearthed crops. It’s a hard but deeply rooted tradition that connects generations across Vietnam’s rural landscapes.
## **How peanuts are harvested in Vietnam**
A team of Vietnamese farmers working together to harvest peanuts
Harvesting peanuts in Vietnam is still very much a hands-on, traditional process, especially in the countryside where small family farms are the backbone of agriculture.
When the plants are ready, usually after about four months of growing, farmers head out to the fields with simple tools — or often just their bare hands. They loosen the soil and carefully pull each peanut plant from the ground, revealing clusters of peanuts clinging to the roots.
With bare hands and steady effort, a Vietnamese farmer pulls peanut plants from the soil
After the plants are lifted, farmers get to work separating the peanuts from the roots. It’s a simple method: the men gather bunches of peanut plants in their hands and thwack them against a hard surface, causing the peanuts to shake loose and scatter.
You can hear a steady thud-thud-thud as the work goes on, filling the fields with the sound of harvest. No fancy tools, no complicated machines — just strong hands and a lot of patience. Before long, big piles of freshly picked peanuts start to take shape, ready to be dried under the sun.

## Drying and shelling Vietnamese peanuts
Peanuts drying under the scorching sun, as farmers rake them evenly for perfect crispness
After the peanuts are separated from the roots, they’re laid out under the sun to dry — a process that usually takes **about 7 to 10 days**. Farmers spread the peanuts in thin layers across large tarps, making sure they catch as much sunlight as possible.
During this time, the peanuts slowly lose their moisture until the kernels inside are completely dry. Once they’re ready, farmers crack open the outer shells by hand to reveal the firm, golden peanuts tucked inside. These peanuts are then either used for cooking, from savory dishes to sweet treats, or pressed into oil for use in everyday Vietnamese kitchens.

## How Vietnamese peanuts are used in cooking and snacks
### Peanuts complete Mi Quang
A bowl of Mì Quảng topped with roasted peanuts
In [Mì Quảng](https://vivavn.com/mi-quang-quang-noodles/) (Quang noodles), a sprinkle of roasted peanuts is a beloved finishing touch. Those golden peanuts do more than add texture — they bring a deep, nutty flavor that ties the whole bowl together. The slight crunch of the peanuts contrasts beautifully with the chewy rice noodles, tender chicken, fresh herbs, and savory broth. Without peanuts, Mì Quảng simply wouldn’t have the same signature character that people across Vietnam love.
### Vietnamese peanut snack
In Vietnam, peanuts aren’t just used in cooking — they’re also enjoyed in a variety of everyday snacks. From salted roasted peanuts and crispy peanut brittle to _đậu phộng da cá_ (coated peanuts with a crunchy shell), these simple treats are often found in markets, served with tea, or casually enjoyed at home.
#### **Vietnamese roasted peanuts**
Vietnamese roasted peanuts – đậu phộng rang muối – are often prepared by tossing raw peanuts in a bit of oil, then roasting them slowly over low heat. A light sprinkle of salt is added while hot, helping the flavor cling. The result is a rich, toasty snack that’s crunchy and satisfying, commonly enjoyed with tea or beer.
#### **Vietnamese peanut brittle**
Another beloved use of peanuts in Vietnam is in kẹo đậu phộng, or Vietnamese peanut brittle. This classic treat is simple yet irresistible — roasted peanuts are coated in caramelized sugar and then pressed into thin, crunchy sheets.
You’ll often find peanut brittle sold in local markets, wrapped in clear plastic bags. Vietnamese peanut brittle has a light, crisp texture that breaks apart easily, releasing the deep, toasty aroma of roasted peanuts with every bite. It’s the perfect balance of sweet and nutty — a simple pleasure that has been enjoyed across generations.
#### **Đậu phộng da cá (crispy-coated peanuts)**
Đậu phộng da cá is a crunchy Vietnamese snack made by coating peanuts in a seasoned flour batter and deep-frying them until golden. In English, it’s often referred to as crispy-coated peanuts, and it differs from regular roasted peanuts due to its crispy shell.
### Peanut butter
In Vietnam, peanut butter is often eaten with bánh mì because it’s quick, simple, and satisfying. It’s also used to make a dipping sauce for fresh spring rolls filled with pork, shrimp, noodles, and herbs. The sauce blends nutty, savory, and slightly sweet flavors — a perfect match for the freshness of the rolls.
### Peanut oil
In Vietnamese kitchens, peanut oil is a common cooking staple, especially in regions where peanuts are grown locally. Known for its light, nutty aroma and high smoke point, peanut oil is ideal for stir-frying, deep-frying, and sautéing.
It enhances the flavor of vegetables, seafood, and meats without overpowering them, making it a favorite in home cooking. Many Vietnamese cooks prefer peanut oil for its ability to bring out the natural richness of ingredients while keeping dishes light and aromatic.
## Vietnamese peanuts: Where to buy
If you’re looking to buy Vietnamese peanuts outside of Vietnam, check your local Asian grocery stores or Vietnamese supermarkets. You can also find them online through platforms like Amazon, Weee!, or specialty Asian food retailers.

### Can I buy Vietnamese peanuts online?

Soursop
## Introduction
The soursop, also known as graviola, or guanábana, is a tropical fruit native to the Americas and the Caribbean. It thrives in hot, humid climates and produces a unique fruit with a creamy texture and a flavor blending sweetness, sourness, and hints of pineapple, strawberry, apple, and banana.
The warm temperatures and high humidity in southern Vietnam create the ideal conditions for soursop trees to thrive.
### How to say “soursop” in Vietnamese 
In Vietnam, soursop is called mãng cầu xiêm (mang cau xiem).
### Vietnam’s top soursop growing regions
Soursop thrives in Vietnam’s southern regions, especially in the Mekong Delta and Central Highlands. Here, provinces like Soc Trang, Kien Giang, Hau Giang, Tien Giang, and Dak Nong are leading the way in soursop cultivation.

## Recipes using soursop that are popular in Vietnam
### Soursop Tea
Vietnamese soursop tea is a type of tea made from the [fruit ](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/)or leaves of the soursop tree. With its naturally sweet and fragrant aroma, this tea is well-loved by many and is suitable for daily consumption to help the body stay healthy and relaxed.
#### How to Make Soursop Tea
Ingredients:
– 200g fresh soursop  
– 75g white sugar  
– 5g [dried tea ](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-tea/)(your choice of jasmine, [lotus](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-lotus-tea/), oolong, etc.)  
– 120ml boiling water  
– Juice of half a lime  
– Ice cubes
Instructions:
– Peel and remove the seeds from the soursop. Shred the flesh into a bowl and mix with 60g of sugar. Let it rest for 1 hour to infuse, or refrigerate for a chilled treat later.
– While the soursop is chilling, prepare the tea. Add the dried tea to a teapot and pour in 120ml of boiling water. Cover and let it steep for 5 minutes to release the flavor.
– Strain the tea into a shaker and add 15g of sugar, stirring until dissolved.
– Add ice cubes, 100g of the chilled soursop, and the lime juice to the shaker. Seal tightly and shake vigorously to combine.
– Pour the soursop tea into a glass, add more ice cubes if desired, and top with the remaining soursop. Stir and enjoy!
### Vietnamese candied soursop
Making candied soursop is a fairly simple process for Vietnamese people. First, the outer skin of the soursop is peeled off, the “flesh” is removed, and the seeds are carefully separated using a knife. The flesh is then mixed with sugar in a ratio of 1 kg of soursop to 0.5 kg of sugar. This mixture is then left for about 2 hours to allow the sugar to permeate the soursop flesh.
Once the soursop and sugar mixture has marinated for a sufficient amount of time, the cook will place a thick-bottomed pan over heat and add the mixture to sauté on low heat.
The jam is ready when the sugar has thickened, the moisture has evaporated, and the desired chewy texture has been achieved. The cook will then remove the pan from the heat and spread the jam out to dry in the [sun ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun)for about 3 hours to further enhance its chewiness and translucency.
Once the jam has dried, it is carefully transferred using a small spoon into individual pieces of plastic wrap, which are then tightly rolled up at both ends, resembling wrapped candies.
### Vietnamese soursop smoothie
To make a Vietnamese soursop smoothie, start by peeling and cutting the soursop into appropriately sized pieces, removing the seeds. Place the soursop pieces into a blender and add a a little water, along with some fresh milk and condensed milk. Blend the ingredients until smooth. Next, add a few ice cubes to the blender and continue blending until you reach your desired consistency. Once the smoothie is ready, stop blending and pour it into a glass to enjoy.

## Hue vs Hoi An: A Quick Comparison
### Geography and population overview of Hue and Hoi An
Hue, a city located in central Vietnam, has a population of over 1.1 million people and covers an area of 5,025.30 square kilometers (1,940.45 square miles). Around 120 kilometers (75 miles) to the south is Hoi An, a small town in Quang Nam Province with a population of over 98,000. Hoi An is much smaller, covering just 61 square kilometers (23.8 square miles).
Both cities are famous travel destinations in Vietnam, each with its own unique beauty, rich historical significance, and vibrant culture. In 1993, UNESCO officially recognized the Complex of Hue Monuments as a World Heritage Site, and in 1999, the ancient town of Hoi An was also recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site.
## The History of Hue vs. The History of Hoi An (Royalty vs. Trade)
Hue used to be the capital of Vietnam during [the Tay Son Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2y_S%C6%A1n_dynasty) (1788–1801), under the rule of Emperor Quang Trung. Later, it became the capital of [the Nguyen Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_dynasty) from 1802 to 1945, with 13 emperors. It was also the last feudal dynasty in Vietnam.
Hoi An sits along the Thu Bon River, one of Vietnam’s major waterways, with its eastern edge touching the East Sea. Thanks to its prime location and favorable climate, it became a perfect stop for both local and international trading ships. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hoi An thrived as a lively international trading hub, drawing merchants from Japan, China, and many other places. This blend of cultures turned Hoi An into one of Vietnam’s most unique multicultural cities—a legacy you can still see and feel today.
## Hue Architecture vs. Hoi An Architecture (Grand vs. Quaint)
### Hue Architecture
The architecture in Hue is rich and diverse, with the most notable being the imperial palaces, tombs, and religious buildings. The most famous architectural landmark is the Imperial City of Hue, covering over 5 square kilometers (about 1.93 square miles). It was built by Emperor Gia Long starting in 1805 and completed in 1832.
Successive Nguyen emperors also constructed various citadels and palaces, with around 140 structures still standing today. In addition to these, the royal tombs of the Nguyen emperors are scattered around the city, each with its own unique beauty. Hue is also home to many religious buildings, such as temples and pagodas, that reflect traditional Vietnamese folk architecture.
### Hoi An Architecture
The architecture in Hoi An reflects a blend of Vietnamese, Japanese, and Chinese cultures. The streets are narrow and winding, laid out in a grid-like pattern. Along these streets, you’ll find important architectural landmarks as well as ancient houses that showcase the distinctive style of Hoi An’s architecture.

Hoi An’s food is a delightful mix of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese flavors. Once a bustling port town, it attracted Chinese and Japanese traders who settled here and brought their unique culinary traditions. Over time, this led to a fusion of flavors from all three cultures. Notable dishes like Cao Lau (a noodle dish), Hoanh Thanh, and [Mi Quang](https://vivavn.com/mi-quang-quang-noodles/) (Quang noodles) are prime examples of this cultural blend.

FAQs
## What is butterfly pea tea?
Butterfly pea tea is a naturally blue herbal tea made by steeping the petals or whole flowers of the butterfly pea plant (Clitoria ternatea) in hot water.
Native to Southeast Asia and popular in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam) and Thailand, this vibrant tea is known for its stunning blue color and its ability to change color to purple when you add lemon juice.
Naturally caffeine-free, it’s often enjoyed as a calming, relaxing drink and is sometimes used in natural remedies and [**wellness teas**](https://vivavn.com/vietnam-herbal-tea/).
You can make it using fresh flowers, dried petals, or tea bags.
_Butterfly pea tea color change – before and after lime_
## What does it taste like?
Butterfly pea flowers don’t have a strong flavor — they taste slightly vegetal or grassy. When brewed as tea, the flavor becomes very mild and earthy.
This subtle taste makes butterfly pea tea a great base for mix-ins like lemon juice, honey, or mint. When lemon is added, the tea not only changes color from blue to purple, but the flavor also becomes brighter and gently citrusy.
Overall, it’s a light, refreshing, and calming drink — not too sweet, not too sour — just enough to soothe your senses.
## Ingredients you’ll need
Making butterfly pea tea is simple, and you only need a few basic ingredients:
Butterfly pea flowers (fresh or dried)
Hot water
Lemon or lime juice (optional – for color change and a light citrusy, tangy flavor)
Honey or sugar (optional, for sweetness)
Ice (if you prefer iced tea)
## How to make butterfly pea tea (fresh or dried)
Before you begin, gently rinse the fresh butterfly pea flowers to remove any dust or dirt. If you’re using dried flowers, there’s no need to rinse — just follow the same steps below. The process is nearly identical either way.
* * *
**Step 1:** Bring water to a boil, then pour it over butterfly pea flowers in a cup or glass teapot (use about 10 fresh flowers or 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried flowers for 500ml of water).
There’s no exact amount you have to use — since the flowers don’t have a strong flavor, it’s really about how deep you want the color. Just a few flowers will give you a light blue, while a generous handful creates a rich, vibrant hue. Feel free to experiment!
* * *
**Step 2:** Let the flowers steep for 5–10 minutes. The longer you steep, the deeper the color.
* * *
**Step 3:** Strain out the flowers using a fine mesh strainer.
Once you’ve strained the tea, let it cool before adding lemon juice or honey.
* * *
**Step 4:** Add lemon juice for a beautiful color shift from blue to purple.
* * *
**Step 5:** Add honey for a touch of natural sweetness, then stir to let it dissolve evenly.
* * *
**Step 6:** Serve warm, or add ice if you enjoy your tea cold and refreshing.
## Butterfly pea tea bags: A convenient way to enjoy blue tea
If you’re short on time — or simply prefer something a bit more convenient — butterfly pea tea bags might be a lovely option to try.
They still bring out that beautiful blue color and gentle, calming effect, without the need to measure or handle loose flowers.
You can steep one tea bag in a cup of hot water for about 5 to 10 minutes. The result is a soothing blue tea with a delicate, earthy flavor. Add lemon juice to watch the color shift to purple, or a touch of honey for sweetness.
You can find some of our recommended Vietnamese-style blue tea bags on Amazon **[here](https://amzn.to/4ksHoou)** — affiliate link, at no extra cost to you.
## Frequently asked questions about making blue tea
### What does butterfly pea tea taste like?
It’s very mild, slightly earthy, and not bitter. Great with lemon or honey.
### How do you make butterfly pea tea from dried flowers?
It’s simple! Just add 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried butterfly pea flowers to a cup of hot water. Let them steep for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how deep you want the color. Then strain, and enjoy. You can also add lemon juice or honey to enhance the flavor and color.
### Can I make blue tea with a tea bag?
Absolutely. Butterfly pea tea bags are a convenient option, especially if you don’t have access to fresh or dried flowers. Just steep one tea bag in hot water for a few minutes until the tea turns a deep blue. Add lemon or lime juice to watch it shift to purple!
### How many flowers do I need for one cup of tea?
There’s no strict rule — it depends on how strong you like your tea. Usually, **4 to 6 fresh flowers** or **1 to 2 teaspoons of dried flowers** is enough for one cup. The flowers don’t have a strong taste on their own, so you can use more if you want a richer color.

## What is nuoc mam? Understanding Vietnamese fish sauce
Nuoc mam, or Vietnamese fish sauce, is a traditional Vietnamese condiment made by fermenting fish with salt. Known for its bold, savory flavor, it is a key ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine and is often paired with various Vietnamese spices to enhance its richness. Internationally, it is commonly referred to as “Vietnamese fish sauce,” but _nuoc mam_ is the authentic Vietnamese term. Both names refer to the same unique and flavorful ingredient.
## How to make Vietnamese fish sauce
Vietnamese fish sauce is crafted through a traditional process that creates its unique, savory flavor. Here’s how it’s done:
**Selecting the Ingredients:** Fresh anchovies and high-quality sea salt are key.
**Mixing:** Anchovies are combined with salt in a 3:1 ratio and stored in wooden barrels.
**Fermentation:** The mixture is left to ferment for 12 months, allowing the flavors to develop.
**Extraction:** After a year, the dark amber fish sauce is extracted, rich in aroma and flavor.
To better understand the traditional process, here’s a quick visual guide to how Vietnamese fish sauce is made
In addition to anchovies, mackerel, and scad fish are also commonly used to make fish sauce in Vietnam, each contributing their own unique flavor profile to the final product.
## What makes Vietnamese fish sauce unique?
Vietnamese fish sauce, or _nuoc mam_ , is an essential ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine. From iconic dishes like _pho_(Vietnamese noodle soup), _bun bo_(Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup), and _[nem ran](https://vivavn.com/nem-ran-vietnamese-fried-spring-rolls/)_ (fried spring rolls), to _[banh xeo](https://vivavn.com/banh-xeo-vietnamese-pancakes/) _(Vietnamese sizzling pancakes**)** , it’s hard to imagine Vietnamese food without it. Let’s dive in and discover what makes _nuoc mam_ so special.
### 1. High-quality ingredients
The foundation of Vietnamese fish sauce lies in its ingredients. The primary fish used is anchovy, caught at the peak of its season to ensure it is fatty and flavorful, then combined with pure sea salt.
### 2. Long fermentation process
Unlike many fish sauces that ferment for only a few months, Vietnamese fish sauce undergoes a long fermentation process. Anchovies and salt are left to ferment in wooden barrels for at least 12 months, allowing the proteins to break down and develop a rich, complex flavor prized in Vietnamese cuisine.
### 3. Rich and complex flavor profile
Vietnamese fish sauce has a unique aroma that no other fish sauce in the world can replicate. It’s known for its deep umami flavor, perfectly balanced between salty, sweet, and savory notes. This distinct taste comes from centuries of expertise passed down through generations of Vietnamese fish sauce makers.
### 4. Cultural significance
In Vietnamese culture, fish sauce (_nuoc mam_) is more than just a seasoning—it represents connection. A bowl of fish sauce is placed at the center of the family table during meals, symbolizing community, love, and togetherness.
## How to use Vietnamese fish sauce in cooking
In Vietnamese cuisine, fish sauce (_nuoc mam)_ is a key ingredient used in a variety of ways, enhancing the flavor profile of many dishes. Here are the most common uses:
**Nuoc cham (Vietnamese dipping sauce):** A flavorful mixture made from fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, garlic, chili, and water.
**Seasoning for cooking** : Fish sauce, along with other spices, is used to marinate ingredients before cooking.

It’s the sauce that ties so many iconic dishes together – think _goi cuon_ (fresh spring rolls), _banh xeo_ (Vietnamese pancake), _nem ran_ (Vietnamese fried spring rolls), … Its base is typically made from **fish sauce (nuoc mam)** mixed with other ingredients such as:
**Sugar** : Adds a hint of sweetness.
**Lime juice or vinegar:** Provides a tangy balance.
**Garlic and chili:** Introduces heat and aroma.
**Water:** Helps dilute and balance the flavors.
### **How to make nuoc cham – Vietnamese dipping sauce**
Here’s an easy step-by-step authentic Vietnamese nuoc cham recipe:
**Ingredients:**
1 tablespoon high-quality fish sauce
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon sugar
4 tablespoons water
Finely chopped garlic and chili
**Instructions:**
**Dissolve the sugar:** Combine 4 tablespoons of water with 1 tablespoon of sugar in a bowl. Stir until the sugar is fully dissolved. If the water is warm, the sugar will dissolve much faster.
**Add fish sauce and lime juice:** Mix in 1 tablespoon of fish sauce and 1 tablespoon of fresh lime juice. Stir well to combine.
**Incorporate garlic and chili:** Add finely chopped garlic and chili to the mixture. Stir until evenly distributed.
**Let it rest:** For the best flavor, let the sauce sit for at least 15 minutes.

Dear Thandar Phru,
Thank you for reaching out and sharing about your eco-friendly initiatives. It’s inspiring to see organizations like yours promoting sustainability and biodegradable solutions.
At VivaVN, our mission is to serve as a bridge to introduce authentic Vietnamese products to the world. However, we are not the manufacturers of Areca products. Currently, we are in contact with the founder of Mo Cau Xu Tien, the producer of the items you mentioned.
Once we receive their response regarding your request, I will promptly inform you.
Thank you for your patience, and please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.
Best regards,

Dear Mihaela,  
  
Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in Top Coco Baked Coconut Crackers. At this moment, we are not certain whether the product is available for purchase in London.  
  
However, I would recommend you to directly contact the manufacturer for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the availability of Top Coco products in your area.

### [Vietnamese Coconut Nectar: Sokfarm’s Sustainable Sweetener](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coconut-nectar/)
## What is Bon Bon Vietnamese fruit?
The Bon Bon Vietnamese fruit, known as ‘bòn bon’ and in some regions as ‘lòn bon,’ is a tropical fruit. The tree typically reaches a height of 10-15 meters, and the fruit itself is round with a diameter ranging from 3-5 cm.

Bon Bon fruits grow in clusters, usually with 20 to 40 fruits per cluster. When they ripen, the skin of the Bon Bon fruit turns a light brown color. When you peel the skin of the Bon Bon fruit, you’ll find 5-6 translucent white segments inside. In each segment, there is one seed.
The Bon Bon fruit, scientifically known as Lansium domesticum, is also referred to as langsat or lanzones in English. It belongs to the Meliaceae family. The species is native to Southeast Asia.
Bon Bon fruits are usually picked during September and October annually. They tend to crack when exposed to heavy rain or intense sunlight.

## In Vietnam, where are Bon Bon fruits primarily grown?
The Bon Bon tree is mainly grown in mountainous areas and the midlands of Quang Nam province, with Tien Phuoc being considered the ‘capital’ of this plant. The Bon Bon fruit from Tien Phuoc is known for its unique flavor and sweetness, and it was historically offered to the king as a special delicacy. Additionally, the tree is also cultivated in the Mekong Delta provinces of Ben Tre, Can Tho, and Hau Giang.
**Did you know?**
Quang Nam is renowned for the ancient town of Hoi An, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site. Meanwhile, Tien Phuoc is a mountainous district in Quang Nam province, located approximately 80km southwest of Hoi An.
Tien Phuoc isn’t just known for its Bon Bon fruit; it’s also the base for startups creating eco-friendly products from **[areca leaf sheaths.](https://vivavn.com/areca-leaf-sheaths/)**
## Tasting the Bon Bon Vietnamese fruit
To enjoy a Bon Bon fruit, you’ll first need to remove its outer skin, as it’s not edible. Once peeled, you need to separate the seeds from the flesh because they are very bitter. The flesh offers a delightful combination of sweetness with subtle sourness, creating a unique and refreshing flavor profile.
## The legend of Bon Bon fruit in Vietnam
Image: thanhnien.vn
In the past, Bon Bon fruit was also known by the name “Nam trân”. This name originated from a legend about King Gia Long.
Legend has it that during the Tay Son Rebellion, commonly known as the Vietnamese Civil War from 1771 to 1802, when the Tay Son troops attacked the capital city of Phu Xuan, Lord Nguyen Phuc Anh, pursued by the Tay Son forces, fled into the forests of Dai Loc, Quang Nam. In a state of hunger and thirst, he stumbled upon a wild fruit that helped him endure his hunger. After ascending to the throne and adopting the title Gia Long, he remembered the fruit that had saved him and decided to name it “Nam trân”, which means “the precious fruit of the South” in Vietnamese
[**The Tay Son rebellion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A2y_S%C6%A1n_wars) (1771–1802) was a series of military conflicts stemming from the Vietnamese peasant uprising of Tay Son, led by three brothers: Nguyen Nhac, Nguyen Hue, and Nguyen Lu. These conflicts began in 1771 and ended in 1802 when Nguyen Phuc Anh, later known as Emperor Gia Long and a descendant of the Nguyen lords, defeated the Tay Son forces and reunified Dai Viet, subsequently renaming the country Vietnam.
## Tips for selecting ripe and chemical-free Bon Bon
Naturally ripened Bon Bon fruit (Image: VITA MARKET)
**Size:** Opt for Bon Bon fruit that is medium-sized, about the size of your thumb. These are naturally ripened and delicious.
**Skin:** Naturally ripened Bon Bon fruit usually has less attractive skin with blackish spots at the bottom and no sap oozing out when peeled. Avoid fruit with unnaturally shiny, yellowish skin and excessive sap.
**Stem:** The stems of naturally ripened fruit typically have minimal or no sap, appearing fresh and green. In contrast, stems of artificially ripened fruit may have excessive sap and appear dark.
**Flesh:** When buying from markets, ask the vendor to peel one fruit for you to inspect the quality inside. Naturally ripened fruit has translucent flesh with tightly adhering segments and a sweet-sour taste. Artificially ripened fruit, harvested prematurely, has cloudy white flesh with less sweetness and more acidity.
**Seeds:** Deep inside the flesh, seeds of naturally ripened Bon Bon fruit are black, while those of artificially ripened fruit are white with a slight pinkish hue.

## Quang Tri organic rice
Image: Gao Huu Co Quang Tri
Nestled in the fertile plains of central Vietnam, Quang Tri province boasts a unique treasure: [Quang Tri organic rice](https://vivavn.com/?p=2154). Cultivated with meticulous organic methods, this rice transcends the ordinary, offering a taste of purity, sustainability.
Quang Tri’s farmers have been cultivating organic rice since 2017, adhering to rigorous standards throughout the process. From preparing the soil to harvesting, they strictly avoid using pesticides, chemical fertilizers, genetically modified seeds, artificial flavors, preservatives, or chemical bleaching agents.
Quang Tri’s organic rice farming is flourishing, producing an impressive yield of 5.5-6 tons of rice per hectare. With over 200 hectares dedicated to certified organic rice cultivation, the province is making substantial progress in sustainable agriculture.
In early 2023, 15 tons of organic rice from Quang Tri farmers were successfully exported to the European market, marking a significant milestone for the province’s agricultural sector. This achievement demonstrates the high quality of Quang Tri’s organic rice and its potential to compete in the global market.
Quang Tri is a coastal province near the southernmost part of the North Central Coast region, the Central of Vietnam, north of the former imperial capital of Huế. It borders Quang Binh to the north, Thua Thien Hue to the south, Savannakhet of Laos to the west and the East Sea to the east, with 75 kilometres (47 mi) of coast.
## Briet black rice
Image: Hop tac xa giam ngheo Easup
Briet black rice is a unique and rare variety of rice cultivated by the Ê Đê people in the Dak Lak province of Vietnam. This prized rice boasts a black color and is packed with exceptional nutritional value.
Image: Hop tac xa giam ngheo Easup
Briet black rice is grown using organic methods, adhering to the stringent Japanese Agricultural Standard (JAS Organic). This ensures that the rice is free from harmful chemicals and pesticides, making it a healthy and sustainable choice.
Though less common, black rice boasts the highest antioxidant activity and more protein than brown rice. This translates to potential health benefits, from improved eye and heart health to protecting against certain cancers and even supporting weight management. But black rice isn’t just good for you, it’s also visually impressive. Its black color transforms the simplest dish into a stunning culinary creation.

## Quang Nam organic purple rice

The startup, [Lo Gach Cu Farm](https://vivavn.com/lo-gach-cu-farm/), is dedicated to cultivating purple rice using organic methods. This approach not only ensures a healthy and sustainable crop, but also preserves the natural beauty of the surrounding environment.

Golden Star Balm, known in Vietnam as Cao Sao Vang, has a history that dates back to the 1930s.

## What is Vietnamese star apple (Vu sua)?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** Vu sua
**Shape and appearance:** round with smooth, glossy skin ranging from green to purple. Inside, it has a milky, juicy pulp with dark seeds.
**Flavor profile:** sweet, with a jelly-like texture, juicy flesh, and a pleasant fragrance.
**How to enjoy it:** eat fresh by slicing it open and scooping out the flesh, or blend it into smoothies.
**Harvest season:** Vu sua season starts around September and extends until April of the following year.
### The shape and color of vu sua fruit
Vietnamese star apples have a round shape, and they measure between 7 to 12 cm in diameter and weigh around 250 to 350 grams. Their skin is smooth and glossy, coming in colors that range from green to purple. When you cut one open, you’ll discover a milky, juicy pulp inside that surrounds dark seeds.
Star apple trees in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam) generally grow to a height of 4 to 10 meters. Their dense foliage and shallow roots make them vulnerable to strong winds. From fruit set to harvest, the process takes approximately 180 to 200 days, with the harvest season spanning from September to April of the following year.

### Taste and flavor
Among [the best Vietnamese fruits](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/), Vietnamese star apples are known for their sweetness and unique texture, which is like that of jelly. When you eat them, you’ll notice that the meat is juicy, and they have a pleasant fragrance. Whether it’s the green-skinned or purple-skinned variety, star apples deliver that same delicious flavor.
**A quick tip:** The green star apple typically has thinner skin and softer flesh, while the purple variety tends to have thicker skin and firmer, denser flesh.
### Cultivation
Branch grafting is commonly used in Vietnam to propagate star apple trees (Credit: Canh Dong Bat Tan).
Star apple trees thrive in tropical climates with temperatures between 22-34°C and require distinct wet and dry seasons for optimal flowering. In Vietnam, the cultivation of star apple trees commonly involves two methods: from seeds or by grafting.
Grafting is the preferred method. Farmers select healthy branches from mature trees, remove the bark from a section of the branch (about 2 to 3 centimeters long), and cover the exposed area with a nutrient-rich soil mixture to promote root development. This technique ensures strong new trees that maintain the quality of the original tree.
When cultivating star apple trees from seeds, they will start producing fruit after 5 to 7 years. However, using the branch grafting method speeds up the process, allowing for fruit production in about three years.
**Did you know?** The star apple tree is self-pollinating, thanks to its hermaphroditic flowers, which contain both male and female reproductive organs.

## How to eat Viatnamese star apples
If you slice the star apple horizontally, it will look like this
But if you cut it vertically, you’ll get a different view like this.
To enjoy a star apple, you should wash the outer skin thoroughly. Then, use a knife to gently split it in half. Once the fruit is halved, use a spoon to scoop out all the seeds from the center. After removing all the seeds, use the spoon to scoop out the delicious inside flesh of the fruit and enjoy!
**Just a heads up:** The skin of the star apple contains a white, sticky latex substance that irritates the mouth and makes it inedible. The seeds are also not edible.
## How to pick a delicious Vietnamese star apple
**Check the skin** : Look for star apples with bright, smooth, and shiny skin. Avoid ones with wrinkles, shriveled skin, bruises, or cracks, as these may be old or damaged and lacking in flavor. Also, don’t get the unripe ones because they won’t taste sweet and might be bitter.
**Test the Texture** : Gently squeeze the fruit in your hand. Choose ones with thin, soft skin. These are usually the juiciest and most flavorful.
## How to store Vietnamese star apple
**Clean the fruit** : Lightly wipe the surface of the star apples with a damp cloth before storing them.
**Wrap and refrigerate** : Place the star apples in plastic wrap or a sealed bag. Store them in the refrigerator at a temperature between 32-39°F (0-4°C). They should stay fresh for about 7 days.
## The legend of the Vietnamese star apple (Vú sữa)
In Vietnamese, “vú sữa” means ‘milk from the breast” and the origin of the name “vú sữa” is explained in the folklore tale “The Legend of the Vú Sữa Fruit” which Vietnamese students learn in elementary school.
The story is about a little boy who, one day, after being scolded by his mother, became upset and decided to leave home. As he wandered, he didn’t think about his mother waiting at home. The mother cried and waited for her son until she got very tired and died in the garden. Then, something magical happened – she turned into a big tree.
After a long time playing around, the boy felt tired. He missed his mother and decided to return home. However, upon arriving, his mother was nowhere to be found. He called for her but received no response. Feeling lost and alone, he hugged the big tree in the garden and cried.
Suddenly, the tree trembled, and from its branches grew beautiful little flowers. As the flowers withered, fruits grew and quickly ripened. One fruit fell to where the boy stood, he picked it up and took a bite. The fruit juice flowed like milk, with the fragrance and sweetness of breastmilk. As he ate the fruit, all his hunger and thirst disappeared, and he felt better.
Looking up at the tree’s branches, the boy couldn’t contain his emotions and began to cry. The tree seemed to embrace him as if comforting him like a mother would her child. The boy felt deep regret, but he couldn’t change what had happened. He stayed at home, tending to the garden.
The delicious fruits from the big tree became popular among the villagers. They scattered the seeds everywhere and named them vú sữa, which means “milk from the breast”.
## Where is the star apple tree grown in Vietnam?
In rural areas of Vietnam, families often grow a few star apple trees in their home gardens because they provide shade and produce fruit. When it’s time for harvest, they take the star apple fruits to the market to sell and earn extra income.
According to statistics, the star apple tree is primarily cultivated in the Southern region of Vietnam, including provinces such as Tien Giang, Dong Thap, Ben Tre, Can Tho, and Ca Mau. Tien Giang province alone has the largest star apple cultivation area, with over 3,170 hectares, mainly in Chau Thanh district. The most famous star apple variety in this area is called Vu Sua Lo Ren, covering more than 330 hectares.

# Vietnamese Artichoke Tea: Distinguishing the Two Types
[](https://vivavn.com/category/discover/)
5 min
[](https://vivavn.com/tea/)
Tea
_In Vietnam, there are two[**types of tea**](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-tea/)called artichoke tea: green artichoke tea and red artichoke tea. They come from different plants and taste different._
## What’s the difference between green and red Vietnamese artichokes?
### Cynara Scolymus (green artichoke)
Cynara scolymus, also known as green artichoke in Vietnam, is a plant native to Southern Europe, particularly around the Mediterranean. Ancient Greeks and Romans cultivated it for its edible flowers. . The plant can grow up to 1.5 to 2 meters tall, and its leaves are 50–80 cm long.
In the early 20th century, French settlers brought this plant to Vietnam. Nowadays, it thrives in places like Da Lat in Lam Dong Province, Sapa in Lao Cai Province, and Tam Dao in [**Vinh Phuc**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%A9nh_Ph%C3%BAc_province) Province.
### Hibiscus Sabdariffa (red artichoke)
Hibiscus sabdariffa, also known as red artichoke in Vietnam, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It’s an annual plant that typically reaches heights of 1.5 to 2 meters, sporting strikingly bright red flowers atop light purple stems. Thriving in hot and humid climates, it’s resilient even in nutrient-poor soil conditions. Vietnam’s climate is perfect for growing Hibiscus sabdariffa, which is why you’ll see it all over the country.
**Note**
In Vietnam, Hibiscus sabdariffa is often called ‘red artichoke,’ but that can be confusing. It’s not actually related to artichokes (which are Cynara scolymus). Hibiscus sabdariffa is a different plant entirely.
## The colors and flavors of green artichoke tea and red artichoke tea
Green artichoke tea will exhibit a delicate golden yellow or light brown hue, while red artichoke tea features a vivid red reminiscent of cranberry juice.
The green artichoke tea has a naturally sweet and mild flavor. As for the red artichoke tea, it has a slightly tart taste, which becomes sweeter when mixed with sugar, and honey.
## How to make Vietnamese artichoke tea
We’ll show you how Vietnamese people make artichoke tea from both green and red artichoke flowers.
### Green artichoke tea
Green artichoke tea can be made from fresh or dried green artichoke flowers, or from green artichoke tea bags.
#### From fresh artichoke flowers
Vietnamese people wash fresh artichoke flowers, remove the old petals, cut the flowers in half or into quarters lengthwise, put them in a pot of water, and boil until the outer petals are easily pulled off. Then let it cool and scoop out the water to drink.
#### From dried artichoke flowers
Cut the artichoke in half and scoop out the fuzzy center (choke). Thinly slice the remaining artichoke and lay it flat to dry in the sun. This is how Vietnamese people traditionally make dried artichoke.
To brew dried artichoke tea, simply take a handful of dried artichoke and put it in a cup. Pour boiling water over it and let it steep for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, add honey and lemon juice to taste, stir, and enjoy!
#### From green artichoke tea bags

In Vietnam, artichoke tea bags are widely used because they’re convenient. Whenever we want to enjoy artichoke tea, we simply take 1 or 2 tea bags from the box, put them in a cup or teapot, pour boiling water over them, and wait 5-10 minutes. We can also add honey, lemon, ginger, or other ingredients to create different flavors.
### Red artichoke tea
Like green artichoke tea, red artichoke tea can be made using fresh or dried flowers.
#### From fresh red artichoke flowers
[**To make red artichoke tea**](https://vivavn.com/hibiscus-flowers-tea/), Vietnamese people start with 4-5 fresh red artichoke flowers. We wash the flowers with warm water, then add them to a pot of water. We might also add a few slices of ginger, sugar, or honey. We bring the mixture to a boil and simmer for 4-5 minutes. Finally, we pour the tea into a cup and enjoy!
[**How to Make Vietnamese Hibiscus Flower Tea**](https://vivavn.com/hibiscus-flowers-tea/)
#### From dried red artichoke flowers
Here’s how Vietnamese people traditionally prepare dried red artichoke flowers for tea: First, they carefully pick the best-looking flowers. Then, they remove the fuzzy center part, which is called the pistil. Next, they wash the flowers thoroughly to get rid of any dirt, bugs, or unwanted bits. Finally, the flowers are dried to become dried red artichoke tea.
To make dried red artichoke tea, Vietnamese people start with a cup of hot water. We add the red dried artichoke flowers to the water and let it steep for 5-10 minutes. Then, we might add a bit of honey or rock sugar to our cup, stir it up, and enjoy!
## Health benefits of green and red artichokes
### Health benefits of Cynara scolymus (green artichoke)
According to the Healthline website, Cynara scolymus offers a wealth of nutritional benefits. Low in fat and high in fiber, they are packed with essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, folate, phosphorus, and magnesium. Additionally, they may contribute to improving cholesterol levels, regulating blood pressure, and enhancing liver health. Their fiber content supports digestive health and may alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Furthermore, this plant is rich in antioxidants and has been linked to lowering blood sugar levels and exhibiting potential anticancer effects.

### Health benefits of Hibiscus sabdariffa (red artichoke)
According to the Healthline website, Hibiscus sabdariffa is packed with antioxidants, making it a powerful addition to your wellness routine. Not only may it help lower blood pressure and improve blood fat levels, but it could also boost liver health and promote weight loss. Additionally, its compounds show potential in preventing cancer and inhibiting the growth of bacteria.

## History and cultural significance
_The Japanese Covered Bridge spans a small waterway in Hoi An, surrounded by the town’s signature yellow-walled houses_
Back in the 16th century, Hoi An was one of the busiest international trading ports in [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia). Ships from Japan, China, and even Europe anchored here, turning the town into a true cultural crossroads. Among the many foreign merchants, the Japanese and the Chinese were especially influential. They didn’t just trade goods; they also left behind lasting marks on the town’s architecture and cultural identity.
Temples, assembly halls such as [the Fujian Assembly Hall](https://vivavn.com/fujian-assembly-hall/), shophouses, and family homes began to appear, many of which still stand today. But perhaps the most iconic structure of all is the Japanese Covered Bridge. Thought to have been built in the late 16th or early 17th century, the bridge was funded by Japanese merchants and crafted by Vietnamese carpenters. Later, when the Japanese community declined, Chinese merchants took over its care and added a small temple at the back of the bridge.
The mix of Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese influences is what makes the bridge stand out. More than just a way to cross the water, it reflects Hoi An’s history as a place where different cultures came together.

## Architecture of the Japanese Covered Bridge
The Japanese Covered Bridge is about 18 meters long, a little over 10 meters wide including the small temple, and around 6 meters high. Its structure is mainly divided into two parts: the wooden bridge with its tiled roof, and a small temple attached to the bridge.
### **The wooden bridge and its tiled roof**
The bridge is mainly wooden, its floorboards, beams, and pillars carefully crafted and fitted together. Above, a tiled roof provides shade and shelter, turning the bridge into more than just a walkway. The entire structure is supported by stone pillars rising from the water below.
The roof is covered with traditional tiles similar to those found on Vietnamese temples and pagodas. Along the roofline are porcelain decorations featuring dragons, phoenixes, and cloud motifs.

At both ends of the Japanese Covered Bridge, you’ll see statues of a pair of dogs and a pair of monkeys. The exact purpose of these statues isn’t entirely clear. Some say they mark the years the bridge was started and completed, since the dog and the monkey are zodiac animals in the Vietnamese lunar calendar. Others believe they carry spiritual significance in Japanese culture.

### **The temple on the bridge**
When the Japanese traders left Hoi An, the Chinese community took over the bridge and later added a small temple at its back.
Above the entrance of the temple, you’ll see a plaque with three Chinese characters. This is the official name of the bridge, given by Lord Nguyen Phuc Chu during his visit in 1719. The name means “the bridge welcomes travelers from afar.”
Just below the plaque are two round wooden blocks, known locally as “door eyes.” Common in old Hoi An houses, they’re believed to greet good guests while keeping away unwanted spirits.
Inside the temple, you’ll find an altar dedicated to the Northern God, a Taoist deity believed to bring peace and protection to the local community. During the full moon festivals and Vietnamese New Year, locals come here to offer incense, showing their respect and devotion while asking for blessings from the deity.

## Everything you need to know before visiting the Japanese Covered Bridge

**Opening hours:** 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM daily

## What is piper lolot?
Piper lolot (_Piper sarmentosum_), also known as wild betel leaf or “la lot” in Vietnamese, is a tropical herb native to Southeast Asia. It has a distinctive aroma that is highly prized in Vietnamese cuisine, commonly featured in dishes such as grilled beef wrapped in piper lolot (_bo nuong la lot_), stir-fried beef with piper lolot (_bo xao la lot_), as well as in various stir-fries and soups.

## What is betel leaf?
Betel leaf (_Piper betle_) is a leaf traditionally used in Vietnamese and Southeast Asian cultures. Unlike piper lolot, it’s rarely used in cooking. Instead, betel leaf plays a key role in rituals and ceremonies, often chewed with areca nut and symbolizing respect and longevity.

## **Key differences between piper lolot and betel leaf**
### Appearance and growth habits
#### **Leaves**
Both piper lolot and betel leaf have a heart-shaped appearance, but there are subtle differences. The betel leaf tends to be longer and narrower, almost tapering toward the tip, while the lolot leaf is slightly shorter, wider, and more rounded, giving it a fuller, softer look overall. Both leaves are deep green in color, but the surface of the betel leaf is glossier and smoother.

#### **Stem comparison**
Both piper lolot and betel leaf have soft, segmented stems with visible nodes. However, piper lolot stems are typically lighter green when young, turning darker green as they mature. In contrast, betel leaf stems start out green but gradually shift to a purplish hue with age.
_This close-up image shows the stems of piper lolot plants_
_The image highlights the stems of the betel leaf plant_
#### **Growing environment:**
Piper lolot prefers shady, damp environments. It grows close to the ground and thrives under the canopy of larger plants or trees, away from direct sunlight. Betel leaf, on the other hand, is a climbing vine. It grows best with vertical support—like a wall or trellis—and does well in warm, humid spots with filtered light.

### **Taste and aroma**
When fresh, piper lolot has a mild spiciness with a slight tingling sensation on the tongue and a hint of bitterness. Its flavor is pleasantly aromatic and never overpowering. Once added to hot dishes, its aroma deepens, becoming rich, fragrant, and savory.
Betel leaf has a bold, peppery flavor with a sharp, almost medicinal aroma. It delivers a warm, slightly spicy bite with a hint of bitterness and a pungent, herbal aftertaste that some find overpowering.
## How Piper lolot and betel leaf are used in Vietnamese cuisine and culture
In Vietnam, Piper lolot (_la lot_) and betel leaf (_la trau_) are used in very different ways—one in the kitchen, the other in tradition.
Piper lolot is a beloved [cooking herb in Vietnamese cuisine](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/). Its mildly spicy, aromatic flavor makes it perfect for wrapping meats in dishes like grilled beef in lolot leaf or stir-fried beef with piper lolot. It’s also used in stir-fries and soups.
Betel leaf, on the other hand, plays a more cultural and ceremonial role. It’s rarely eaten as food, but traditionally chewed with areca nut as part of social rituals, especially among older generations. Betel leaves are also featured in wedding ceremonies and ancestral offerings, symbolizing respect, connection, and love.
Though they may look similar, their roles in Vietnamese life couldn’t be more different—one flavors the meal, the other carries meaning.

In this article, I’ll take you on a journey through the world of Vietnamese watermelons, exploring their different varieties, the legend of the Vietnamese watermelon, health benefits, delicious recipes, and how Vietnamese farmers grow these wonderful fruits.
## The legend of the Vietnamese watermelon
Once upon a time, there was a man named Mai An Tiêm who was beloved by King Hung and adopted as his son. One day, due to a misunderstanding of An Tiêm’s words, the king became angry and exiled him to a deserted island.
On the island, An Tiêm and his wife built a house from bamboo and made clothes from dried grass. One day, An Tiêm saw a flock of birds dropping black seeds. He picked up the seeds, planted them in the sand, and thought, “If birds can eat this, so can people.” Soon, the seeds grew into a sprawling vine, which produced fruit with dark green skin, red flesh, black seeds, and a sweet, refreshing taste. An Tiêm and his wife planted these fruits all over the island.
When the fruit was ripe, An Tiêm carved his name into one of them and let it float out to sea, hoping the waves would carry it to the mainland. A local fisherman found the unusual fruit and brought it to the king. Realizing his mistake, the king welcomed An Tiêm and his wife back home.
The strange fruit was what we now call watermelon, or “dưa hấu” in Vietnamese.
## Growing and harvesting Watermelons in Vietnam
In northern Vietnam, the cold winter weather makes it difficult for watermelons to grow. Therefore, there are two growing seasons each year in this region: one in spring, where seeds are planted at the end of February and harvested in May, and another in summer, where seeds are planted in June and harvested in August.
In central and southern Vietnam, the climate is ideal for growing watermelons, so they are cultivated throughout the year.
Typically, in Vietnam, harvesting begins 30 to 35 days after pollination. To ensure the watermelons are sweet and of good quality, farmers reduce or stop watering the plants 7 to 10 days before harvest, depending on the soil conditions. After that, they carefully cut and transport the watermelons, using straw to cushion them and prevent bruising.
## Vietnam’s top watermelon-growing regions
In Vietnam, watermelons are cultivated across the entire country, thriving in several key regions. In the North, you’ll find major production areas in Hanoi, Hai Duong, Nam Dinh, Thai Binh, Vinh Phuc, and Phu Tho. Moving to the Central Coast, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, and Phu Yen are the hotspots for watermelon farming. Down in the Mekong Delta, the provinces of Long An, Dong Thap, Soc Trang, Hau Giang, Can Tho, Vinh Long, Tra Vinh, and Tien Giang are particularly prominent for their watermelon production.
## Watermelon growing conditions
### Weather
Watermelons thrive in warm weather and require dry conditions with plenty of sunshine to produce quality fruit.
### Soil
They grow best in well-drained soils such as sandy, sandy loam, or alluvial soils.
### **pH and temperature**
The optimal pH range for soil is between 6.0 and 7.0, and the ideal temperature range is 25-30°C.
### Day and night conditions
Cool nights and warm days are ideal as they help with the accumulation of sugars in the fruit, enhancing sweetness.
## The different varieties of Vietnamese watermelon
### Red-fleshed watermelon
Red-fleshed watermelons are the most popular variety in Vietnam for several reasons. First, the vibrant red color is highly favored in Vietnamese culture, symbolizing luck, prosperity, and happiness.
Additionally, this type of watermelon is well-suited to Vietnam’s natural conditions, making it easy to cultivate. The combination of cultural significance and suitability for local growing conditions has made red-fleshed watermelons a favorite among both farmers and consumers.
### Yellow-fleshed watermelon
The reason some watermelons have yellow flesh is due to the pigments they contain. While red-fleshed watermelons are rich in lycopene, which gives them their red color, yellow-fleshed watermelons have less lycopene and more beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is the pigment responsible for the yellow or orange color in these watermelons.
### Seedless watermelon
Seedless watermelons aren’t completely seedless. They have fewer seeds than regular watermelons, and the seeds are less developed. You might still find some small, immature seeds in them. This happens because seedless watermelons are bred to have the fruit ripen faster than the seeds can mature. Once the watermelon is picked, the seeds stop developing.
## Nutritional facts of watermelon
Watermelon is delicious and full of essential nutrients with many health benefits. Here’s a look at its nutritional profile:
**Water content:** Watermelon is aptly named, as it’s composed of around 91% water, making it an excellent choice for staying hydrated, especially during the hot summer months.
**Vitamins and minerals:** This juicy fruit is a good source of vitamins A, C, and B5, as well as potassium, and copper.
**High citrulline and lycopene:** Watermelon is rich in citrulline and lycopene. **[Citrulline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6369322/)** helps lower blood pressure, while **[lycopene](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35216071/),** which gives watermelon its red color, is a powerful antioxidant that supports heart health and boosts vitamin A production.
**Low in Calories and Fat** : Despite its sweet flavor, watermelon is relatively low in calories and contains no fat.
For a detailed breakdown of its nutritional components, including vitamins, minerals, and other key nutrients, you can check the comprehensive data available **[here](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/167765/nutrients)**.
## Health benefits of watermelon
**Supports heart health** : Watermelon is rich in citrulline, an amino acid that can help improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart disease.
**Boosts immune function** : With its high vitamin C content, watermelon can help strengthen the immune system and protect against infections.
**Aids hydration** : As mentioned earlier, watermelon’s high water content makes it an excellent choice for staying hydrated, especially during hot weather or physical activity.
**Supports muscle recovery** : Watermelon is a good source of citrulline, an amino acid that can help reduce muscle soreness and improve recovery after [**exercise**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6099278/).

### Roasted watermelon seeds (hạt dưa)
Roasted watermelon seeds (hạt dưa) are an essential snack during the Vietnamese Lunar New Year (**[Tết](https://vivavn.com/what-is-tet/)**). They are often served to guests or enjoyed by family members throughout the holiday, symbolizing luck and prosperity for the new year.
## Carved watermelons for the Lunar New Year
In Vietnam, during the Lunar New Year, it’s a tradition to buy watermelons with intricate carvings of letters or symbols to place on the ancestral altar. For Vietnamese people, these specially carved watermelons symbolize prosperity and luck for the coming year.
## How to pick a ripe Vietnamese watermelon
### Check the stem
Look for a dried, curly stem. A green or moist stem indicates the watermelon may not be fully ripe.
### Examine the filed spot
The field spot is the large, creamy yellow area where the watermelon rested on the ground. A deep yellow spot suggests ripeness and sweetness, while a white spot might mean it’s not as ripe.
### Inspect the color
Choose a watermelon with a dark green color and a strong, consistent stripe pattern. This indicates a ripe fruit.
### Tap the watermelon
When you tap a ripe watermelon with your hand or fist, it should make a deep sound.
### Choose the heaviest one
If the melons are similar in size, pick the heaviest one. It’s likely to be juicier.

## What is rambutan fruit?
Rambutan is a small, round, or oval fruit, typically measuring 3-6 cm long and 3-4 cm wide. It grows in clusters of 10-20 fruits, with a vibrant red or yellow skin covered with soft, hair-like spikes that give it a unique and exotic appearance. Inside, the fruit reveals a whitish, translucent flesh that is juicy and attaches to a large seed at its center.
Rambutan trees typically grow between 12 and 20 meters tall. However, through selective cloning, shorter varieties have been developed that only reach 3 to 5 meters. These compact trees are much easier to harvest.
In Vietnam, rambutan trees are usually propagated through grafting, as growing them from seeds often results in lower yields. Farmers prefer grafting to ensure higher productivity. Rambutan trees typically begin bearing fruit after 4 to 5 years, with peak production occurring between 8 to 10 years. The fruit takes about 100 to 120 days to ripen from the time the flowers bloom.
Rambutan trees thrive in temperatures between 22-30°C but struggle in extreme conditions—flowers and fruit drop significantly when temperatures exceed 40°C, while cooler temperatures below 22°C slow down flowering. In Vietnam, the rambutan harvest season generally runs from May to July each year.
Young rambutan fruits
A rambutan tree can grow over 10 meters tall.
A rambutan tree stands at about 3 meters tall, making it easy to harvest.
## Flavor profile
Rambutan has a sweet, tropical aroma with a subtle hint of mango and vanilla. Its flavor is smooth and gentle, making it very pleasant and easy to enjoy. The white flesh of ripe rambutan has a sweet and subtly tangy flavor. Its texture is soft and juicy, with a slight chewiness.
## Nutritional highlights of rambutan
The United States Department of Agriculture (**[USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/168167/nutrients)**) Nutrient Database doesn’t provide nutrition facts for fresh rambutan. However, they do list the nutritional information for rambutan canned in syrup, drained, with a serving size of 1 cup (150g).

Choose ripe rambutan, which has a vibrant red or yellow skin. Avoid green or overly dark fruits, as they may be sour or overripe.
**Prepare the fruit** :
Hold the rambutan firmly. Use your fingers or a knife to carefully peel away the spiky, hairy outer skin.
**Extract the flesh and enjoy:**
To separate the juicy flesh from the seed, gently use a knife to slice around the seed or carefully remove the flesh away with your fingers. Alternatively, you can place the rambutan in your mouth and carefully bite into the flesh, making sure not to bite the seed as it is bitter and unpleasant.
## How to store rambutan
When storing rambutan at room temperature, you might notice that the fruit loses weight quickly due to moisture loss. Over a period of 5 to 8 days, rambutan can lose between 22% and 25% of its weight, depending on the variety. The higher the temperature, the more weight the fruit will lose.
To keep rambutan fresh for a longer period, store it in a plastic bag in the refrigerator at 10°C (50°F). This method can extend the fruit’s freshness for up to 2 weeks.
## Fresh rambutan or preserved alternatives
The best way to truly savor the flavor of rambutan is to eat it fresh. There’s nothing quite like the juicy, sweet taste of a ripe rambutan right off the tree. However, since rambutan is a seasonal fruit, it might not always be available. When fresh rambutan isn’t in season, you can still enjoy this tropical delight by opting for canned rambutan or dried rambutan. These alternatives capture the essence of the fruit, letting you experience its unique flavor even when it’s not in season.
### What is canned rambutan?
Canned rambutan is rambutan that has been processed and preserved in tin cans, usually in a sugary syrup to keep the fruit fresh for longer. This is a convenient way to enjoy rambutan when it’s out of season or when fresh rambutan isn’t available.
Fruit producers in Vietnam have developed this canned rambutan product, bringing the unique flavor of this tropical fruit to consumers around the world. The canning process helps retain the fruit’s flavor and quality, though it might not be quite the same as eating it fresh. Canned rambutan can be used as a dessert or an ingredient in various dishes, adding convenience and variety to your menu.
### What is dried rambutan?
Dried rambutan is a convenient way to enjoy this tropical fruit even when it’s out of season. The drying process removes moisture, concentrating the fruit’s natural sweetness and giving it a chewy texture.
While it may not have the same juiciness as fresh rambutan, dried rambutan retains many of its nutrients, including fiber. It’s perfect for snacking, baking, or adding a tropical twist to various dishes. Produced by Vietnamese manufacturers, dried rambutan is typically packaged in sealed bags to maintain its flavor and quality.

FAQs
## What are areca leaf plates?
Areca leaf plates are made from the naturally shed [leaf sheaths](https://vivavn.com/areca-leaf-sheaths/) of the [areca palm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areca). These sheaths are the thick bases of the leaves that wrap around the trunk of the tree. As they naturally fall off and dry, they become a firm material ideal for crafting. The plates are made entirely from these sheaths without chemicals or adhesives, making them safe and eco-friendly. No trees are cut down in the process.

## How are areca leaf plates made in Vietnam?
The production of areca leaf plates begins with selecting only leaves that meet quality standards—strong, durable, and with attractive natural patterns—while discarding any that don’t.
These chosen leaves are then shaped into plates using a heat press machine. Once formed, the plates are sterilized to ensure they meet high hygiene standards, making them safe and ready for use.

## What makes Thanh Ha Pottery Village special?
One of the [must-visit villages in Hoi An](https://vivavn.com/hoi-an-villages/) is Thanh Ha Pottery Village, and it has a charm that sets it apart from other villages in the area. Let’s dive in and explore what makes this village special!
### A legacy of pottery-making that spans 500 years
Thanh Ha Pottery Village was founded in the 16th century, and according to historical records, the first settlers were people from Thanh Hoa, which is about 650 kilometers north of Hoi An. They brought their pottery-making skills with them to build the village. Initially, they focused on crafting everyday pottery items like pots, bowls, plates, and teapots to serve the central region of Vietnam.
The village thrived the most during the 17th and 18th centuries, when [Hoi An](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E1%BB%99i_An) was a bustling trading port, attracting merchants from Japan, China, and the West. During this time, in addition to everyday products, Thanh Ha also began producing containers for export goods.
### Unique traditional pottery-making techniques
One of the most distinctive aspects of Thanh Ha Pottery is its traditional and nearly unique production methods that have been preserved for centuries. The primary material used is brown clay sourced from the Thu Bon River. The artisans here maintain a completely manual production process, shaping the pottery by hand or using a foot-powered wheel, without the use of molds.
What truly sets Thanh Ha apart is the intuitive way the artisans fire their pottery. They don’t rely on temperature measuring tools; instead, they gauge the heat and timing based on their experience and the sound of the fire. Another fascinating aspect is that the absence of glaze and chemical additives results in a diverse range of colors in the finished pieces, such as golden red, brick red, brown, pink, and black.
## What exciting experiences await you in Thanh Ha Pottery Village?
### Watch the artisans craft pottery
When you visit this village, you’ll see how the local artisans craft beautiful pottery from clay. These skilled craftsmen often start their work early in the morning and continue until late in the evening, working alone right in front of their homes, surrounded by rows of their handmade creations.
### Learn to make pottery
Not only can you watch the artisans in action, but you can also get hands-on and make your own pottery with their help. You’ll learn how to shape your creations by hand and add color to your pieces, and you can take home your masterpiece when the workshop is over. It’s a fun experience, and there’s a small fee to participate.
### Visit Thanh Ha Terracotta Park
In the village, you’ll find a spot known as Thanh Ha Terracotta Park, which showcases the products of the local artisans. The park also features pottery from other famous villages in Vietnam, like Bat Trang. One of the highlights of this place is its impressive displays of iconic architectural works from Vietnam and even some of the world’s wonders. It’s a great place to explore and appreciate the art of pottery
### Taking a boat ride on the Thu Bồn River
After exploring Thanh Ha Pottery Village, you can head to the Thu Bon River and take a boat ride back to Hoi An Ancient Town. This delightful experience allows you to take in the scenic countryside on both sides of the river and get a glimpse of the local life along the way.
## How to get to Thanh Ha Pottery Village from Hoi An Ancient Town
Thanh Ha Pottery Village is located about 4 kilometers west of Hoi An’s Ancient Town, and getting there is a breeze. You can reach the village by taxi, Grab, motorbike, bicycle, or even on foot. Just like other villages in the area, we recommend biking for the best experience. Renting a bike is easy, and you’ll find plenty of rental shops around the Old Town.
## Is there an entrance fee for Thanh Ha Pottery Village
The entrance fee for Thanh Ha Pottery Village is about 35,000 VND (about $1.50) for adults and 15,000 VND (about $0.65) for children. With this ticket, you can explore the village and watch the artisans at work. If you want to visit the Thanh Ha Terracotta Park, you’ll need a separate ticket—50,000 VND (around $2.15) for adults and 30,000 VND (about $1.30) for kids. For pottery-making classes, you can contact the local workshops directly for pricing details.

## Legend of Ban Co Peak
According to local folklore, ages ago, two immortal beings played chess atop Son Tra Mountain, locked in an endless stalemate. One day, while some fairy maidens frolicked and bathed at the beach below, distracting one of the immortals, he made a crucial mistake and was defeated. The victorious immortal returned to the heavens, leaving the defeated one behind to ponder his loss. Despite his efforts to find a solution, he remained stuck. In commemoration, the locals erected a stone chessboard, accompanied by a statue of the pensive immortal, naming the mountain peak Ban Co, or Chessboard Peak.

## What is Vietnamese herbal tea?
Vietnam herbal tea refers to a wide range of caffeine-free drinks made from the leaves, stems, roots, or flowers of local herbs. These teas are commonly found in everyday life and traditional practices. While each herb brings its distinct aroma and flavor, many Vietnamese people also believe that different plants offer different health benefits—an idea that comes from centuries of folk medicine.
For example, when feeling stressed, someone might step into the garden, pull up a few stalks of lemongrass, and simmer them into a soothing tea. On chilly mornings or when facing a scratchy throat, a warm cup of ginger tea with honey is a common go-to. Herbal teas like these are simply part of everyday life in many Vietnamese homes. When there’s an abundance of [fresh herbs](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-herbs/), people often dry the extra to store and use later, especially during the rainy season or when certain herbs are harder to find.

_Sun-dried hibiscus flowers—ready for brewing into a vibrant, tart herbal tea._
With its vibrant red color and tart, fruity taste, hibiscus flower tea has become a favorite herbal drink in [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam). The hibiscus plant, which grows well in the country’s tropical climate, produces striking deep-red calyces that appear each year during harvest season. Around this time, it’s common to see large baskets of fresh hibiscus flowers at local markets, especially in rural areas.
The tea can be made using either fresh or dried hibiscus calyces. To prepare it, just steep the flowers in hot water for 10 to 15 minutes until the water turns a bright ruby red. The flavor is naturally tangy and refreshing. Many people balance the sourness with a spoonful of honey, and it’s often served over ice on warm days.
In Vietnamese folk tradition, hibiscus tea is believed to support healthy skin, promote better sleep, and help slow signs of aging.

Winter melon is a climbing vine native to South and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is long and cylindrical, with a pale green rind and soft, white flesh. In Vietnam, winter melon is commonly used in soups, desserts, and beverages for its mild, watery taste and natural cooling effect.
To make winter melon tea, mature fruits are washed, sliced, and sun-dried. Once dried, the slices are lightly roasted to enhance their flavor.

It has a mildly bitter taste with a clean, grassy aroma, and often leaves a gentle sweetness after each taste. In Vietnam, pennywort is used in a variety of everyday dishes, from refreshing soups and salads to smoothies and herbal teas.
To make pennywort tea, the leaves are sun-dried, then simmered in hot water for 5 to 7 minutes until the brew turns an earthy golden-brown. The tea is then strained and served either warm or chilled, depending on the season. A touch of honey and a slice of lemon bring out its fresh, grassy notes.

[Lemongrass](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-lemongrass/) is a tropical herb commonly grown across Southeast Asia, including in Vietnam.

The lower part of the stalk is where the flavor is strongest and is often used in cooking as well as in tea.
To make lemongrass tea, fresh stalks are trimmed, lightly crushed, and gently simmered in water to release their essential oils. A spoonful of honey and a squeeze of lemon juice are often added. The result is a light, fragrant tea with a delicate citrus finish—perfect as a calming drink after meals or a soothing ritual at the end of a long day.
In Vietnam, lemongrass tea is often sipped warm, especially during cooler days or when someone feels under the weather.

The result is a light herbal infusion with a gentle aroma and a subtle, earthy flavor that many find calming and grounding.
We’ve written more about Vietnamese perilla—its traditional uses, herbal tea, and everyday role in local cuisine—[right here](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-perilla/).
## Frequently asked questions about Vietnamese herbal teas
### **Are Vietnamese herbal teas caffeine-free?**
Yes, most Vietnamese herbal teas are naturally caffeine-free. They’re made from various parts of plants—like lemongrass (stalk), hibiscus (flower calyces), winter melon (fruit), butterfly pea (flowers), cinnamon (bark), pennywort (leaves), and perilla (leaves)—making them a soothing, herbal alternative to regular tea or coffee.
### **Which Vietnamese herbal tea is best for hot weather or summer?**
In Vietnam, herbal teas like **winter melon** , **pennywort** , **hibiscus** , and **butterfly pea flower** are often enjoyed during the hot summer months. These herbal drinks are typically served over ice and are valued for their naturally light, refreshing taste. In Vietnamese tradition, they’re also believed to have gentle cooling properties that help the body stay balanced in the heat.
### **Do Vietnamese herbal teas have any health benefits?**
Vietnamese herbal teas are deeply rooted in folk traditions and are often enjoyed not just for their flavor, but also for their believed calming and cooling effects. While not backed by modern clinical research, many of these teas have been used for generations to help ease stress, promote restful sleep, and support the body during hot weather.
### **What’s the best way to brew Vietnamese herbal tea?**
It depends on the herb, but a general method is to simmer or steep the dried or fresh leaves, flowers, or fruit slices in hot water for 5 to 15 minutes. Some teas, like **winter melon** or **lemongrass** , are often simmered longer for deeper flavor. Sweeteners like **honey** or **rock sugar** can be added to taste, and many herbal teas are delicious both warm and iced.

_Tết is the biggest and most important festival[](https://vivavn.com/vietnam-festivals/)for Vietnamese people in the year. In this article, let’s delve into Vietnamese Tet and explore the fascinating aspects of this occasion._
## What is Tết?
Image: Thanh Dat/ www.nhandan.vn
Tết (Tet) or Tết Nguyên Đán (Tet Nguyen Dan) is Vietnam’s most important and cherished festival, celebrating the lunar new year. It’s a time for families to gather, reconnect with loved ones, and visit friends and neighbors. Traditional dishes are lovingly prepared and placed on ancestral altars as a gesture of gratitude to our ancestors. Vietnamese people also exchange heartfelt wishes for a peaceful and prosperous new year.
The Vietnamese Tet is celebrated on the first day of the lunar calendar. However, Vietnamese people believe that before the official Tet day, everything must be prepared early and new, hoping for a lucky and successful start to the new year. Therefore, Tet preparations typically begin a week in advance, starting from the Kitchen Gods’ Day on 23rd of December (Lunar calendar). This is considered the first event heralding another Tet season.
It’s noteworthy that the first day of the lunar new year, Tet, never occurs before January 21st or after February 19th in the solar calendar, typically falling between late January and mid-February.
## The main stages of Tet
### Make offerings for the Kitchen God
Image: www.vnexpress.net
According to Vietnamese beliefs, the Kitchen God is a deity who keeps track of all the good and bad actions performed by households throughout the year and reports them to the Jade Emperor. Every year, on the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, Ong Tao returns to heaven to give his report to the Jade Emperor. According to legend, Ong Tao requires a golden carp as a mode of transportation to ascend to heaven.
Hence, on the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, Vietnamese people buy golden carps and prepare traditional dishes to offer on the altar to bid farewell to Ong Tao as he returns to heaven.
After performing the Kitchen Gods’ ceremony, Vietnamese people release golden carp into rivers and lakes.
### Year-end party (Tất niên)
Image: Huynh hong Dao/ www.vietnamnet.vn
Tất niên signal the end of one year and the start of the new one. It’s a time when family members gather for a special dinner to bid farewell to the old year. Depending on local customs, these celebrations may also involve inviting friends and relatives to join in the festivities.
In the days leading up to the new year, Vietnamese people are bustling with year-end parties. They join in company gatherings, neighborhood festivities, and visit friends’ and neighbors’ houses to celebrate the end of the year together. Across Vietnam, the atmosphere is vibrant and cheerful.
### New year’s eve (Giao thừa)
For Vietnamese people, New Year’s Eve is a significant occasion that symbolizes the elimination of evil spirits, ghosts, and all the negativity from the previous year. it’s the time to welcome prosperity and success for the upcoming year. It is considered a time of restfulness, a moment to cast away worries, a night of tranquility and sanctity.
On New Year’s Eve at exactly midnight, the head of the household will offer two trays of offerings, one placed on the ancestral altar, and the other placed on a small table in front of the house’s courtyard.
Afterward, family members stand solemnly before the ancestral altar to express gratitude and offer prayers for a new year filled with blessings.
### What do Vietnamese people do in the first 3 days of the new year?
Image: Thanh Dat/ www.nhandan.vn
The Vietnamese tradition is to visit the paternal side on the first day, the maternal side on the second day, and teachers on the third day.
#### On the first day
In the morning of the first day of the year, Vietnamese people visit the graves of their ancestors to express respect and honor their origins. Then, they spend this day visiting their paternal relatives.
#### On the second day
On this day, Vietnamese people typically visit relatives and extended family members from their mother’s side.
#### On the third day
According to custom, this day is when students visit their teachers to show appreciation for their guidance and teaching.
#### First footing (Xông đất)
The tradition of ‘xông đất’ has long been practiced in Vietnam. Vietnamese people believe that the first visitor to their home on the first day of the new year (xông đất) is very important because they may bring luck and prosperity to the household for that year. Therefore, in the days leading up to the new year, homeowners ask cheerful and successful friends or neighbors to be the first to step into their home on the first day of the new year.
#### Lucky money (Lì xì)
According to custom, after children offer Tet greetings to family members, grandparents or parents will give them red envelopes containing some money along with wishes for a healthy and prosperous new year. Vietnamese people call this “lì xì” (lucky money).
## The things Vietnamese people avoid on Tet
### Don’t sweep the house or take out the trash on the first day of the new year.
According to Vietnamese tradition, sweeping the house and throwing out the trash on the first day of the new year means getting rid of luck and wealth. So, Vietnamese people don’t sweep or throw out trash on this day.
### Do not ask to borrow a lighter
Fire, according to Vietnamese belief, symbolizes luck. Giving fire at the beginning of the new year means giving away one’s own and family’s luck. Therefore, on the first day of the new year, Vietnamese people avoid asking to borrow a lighter.
### Avoid breaking household items
Vietnamese people believe that breaking dishes, cups, or mirrors on New Year’s Day indicates division and bad relationships in the coming year.
## The traditional foods of Vietnamese people during the Tet holiday.
### Bánh chưng (Chung cake)
[Chung cake](https://vivavn.com/chung-cake/) is a time-honored traditional cake in Vietnam, crafted from ingredients like glutinous rice, mung beans, pork, and dong leaves (or banana leaves). The cake is created by combining these ingredients, wrapping them in a square shape with dong leaves, and then boiling them for approximately half a day.
### Boiled chicken
The chicken is one of the animals deeply connected with Vietnamese people throughout history. In rural Vietnam, nearly every household raises chickens. Traditionally, the crowing of roosters at dawn signaled the start of a new day and called people to work in the fields. Chickens also provide both meat and eggs for families.
During the Tet holiday, a boiled chicken is a must-have dish on the table, symbolizing a fresh start, good fortune, and hopes for a prosperous year ahead.
### Nem rán (fried spring roll)
Nem rán (fried spring rolls), also known as chả giò in some regions, are an indispensable dish during Tet for Vietnamese people. This dish is made by wrapping the filling in rice paper wrappers, then frying them. The filling usually includes ground pork, vegetables, glass noodles, and mushrooms.
In Vietnam, it’s common to see women in the family gathering together to roll spring rolls on Tet days. Therefore, spring rolls also symbolize “harmony and love,” bringing family members closer.
### Chả lụa
Chả lụa, also known as Vietnamese pork roll, is made from two basic ingredients: lean pork (the pork has to be pounded into a paste) mixed with fish sauce, wrapped in [banana ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana)leaves, and then boiled.
In the past, chả lụa was considered a delicacy, symbolizing luxury, and was only offered to kings and nobles on significant occasions. Today, chả lụa is a Tet holiday dish symbolizing wishes for prosperity and peace.
### Xôi gấc (red sticky rice)
In Vietnamese belief, red is the color of luck and happiness. That’s why during Tet, there must be a plate of red sticky rice. Red sticky rice is made from [glutinous rice](https://vivavn.com/what-is-glutinous-rice/) mixed with fresh Gac fruit and then steamed. Once cooked, the sticky rice turns a beautiful, enticing shade of red.
“Gac,” a fruit from Asia, is also called “baby jackfruit”, or “sweet gourd” in English. When it’s ripe, it turns deep orange, has a prickly outside, and contains bright red flesh and seeds inside. In Vietnam, it’s been used in food and medicine for a long time.
## The five-fruit tray 
On Tet, each Vietnamese family offers a five-fruit tray on the ancestral altar. The fruits may vary in different regions of Vietnam, but all trays must consist of types of [Vietnamese fruits](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-fruits/) with harmonious colors, symbolizing wishes for a prosperous and peaceful new year.
Although it is called a five-fruit tray, it does not necessarily contain exactly 5 kinds of fruit.
### The types of fruits in the five-fruit tray in Northern Vietnam
For those in the North, a stunning five-fruit tray should comprise various fruits: a hand of green bananas, a ripe pomelo (or Buddha’s hand), persimmons, a bunch of kumquats, and a pineapple. These fruits should exhibit vibrant yet harmonious colors, adhering to the Five Elements theory.
A hand of green bananas symbolizes unity and harmony. A ripe pomelo, with its golden color, represents wealth and luck. Alternatively, a Buddha’s hand can replace the pomelo.
A bunch of kumquats adorns the tray with their bright red and yellow hues, symbolizing luck and success. Pineapples, known for their fragrant aroma, signify wishes for a peaceful and prosperous new year.
### The types of fruits in the five-fruit tray in Southern Vietnam
In the South, sugar-apples, [coconuts](https://vivavn.com/vietnamese-coconut/), papayas, mangos, and figs are favored for the five-fruit tray, as they phonetically resemble the phrase “wishing for enough fortune” in Vietnamese.
## Summary
Tet is Vietnam’s biggest and most important festival. It celebrates the lunar new year and is a time for families to come together, catch up with relatives, and visit friends and neighbors.
The main stages of Tet include making offerings for the Kitchen Gods, year-end parties, welcoming the New Year’s Eve, and the first three days of the new year.
According to Vietnamese tradition, certain actions are avoided on the first day of the new year to prevent bad luck for the rest of the year.
The traditional foods of the Vietnamese people during Tet and the significance of each dish.
During the traditional New Year celebrations, a five-fruit tray is essential for every Vietnamese family as part of the offerings placed on ancestral altars.

The [Da Nang ](https://vivavn.com/category/da-nang/)International Fireworks Festival was first held in Da Nang City in 2008. 2024 marks the 12th year this dazzling event will illuminate Da Nang City.
The Da Nang International Fireworks Festival has transformed over time. Before 2017, it was a more condensed event, lasting just 2 days with 4 or 5 teams competing. The festival typically took place in March or April, often coinciding with major holidays in Da Nang.
However, since 2017, the festival has grown significantly. It now stretches across 2 whole months, featuring around 8 teams dazzling audiences every Saturday night. This extended schedule reflects the festival’s increasing popularity and Da Nang’s commitment to offering visitors a longer and more spectacular fireworks experience.
Between 2020 and 2022, the Da Nang International Fireworks Festival was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## What is dried dragon fruit?
Dried dragon fruit is simply dragon fruit that has been preserved by removing its moisture. This process helps extend the shelf life while keeping much of the fruit’s natural flavor and color. The fruit may look different from its fresh form, but it still offers a way to enjoy dragon fruit conveniently, even when it’s out of season.
[Dragon fruit](https://vivavn.com/dragon-fruit/), also known as _pitaya_ , has a mild sweetness and a soft texture when fresh. In dried form, it becomes either chewy or crisp, depending on how it’s processed. Many people use it as a light snack or add it to other foods like salads, desserts, smoothie bowls, or refreshing drinks.
_Red-fleshed dragon fruit—commonly used to make dried dragon fruit thanks to its vibrant color and natural sweetness._
Dragon fruit comes in two main varieties: one with white flesh and one with red flesh. While both are mildly sweet and refreshing, the red-fleshed variety tends to be sweeter and more vibrant in color. That’s why it’s more commonly used for dried products. When dried, its bright pink hue stays visually appealing without any need for added coloring.

## Crispy (freeze-dried) vs. Chewy (dehydrated): What’s the Difference?
Dried dragon fruit is available in two main types: crispy and chewy. Each offers a different texture and is made using a different drying method. Knowing the difference can help you choose the one that best suits your taste or how you plan to enjoy it.
### **Freeze-dried dragon fruit (crispy)**
#### Method
Freeze-dried dragon fruit is made by first freezing the fruit and then removing its moisture in a vacuum environment. This technique, known as freeze-drying, helps preserve the fruit’s shape, color, and nutrients without the use of added sugar or preservatives.

#### Texture
The result is a dry, crisp texture that’s light and airy. Unlike chewy dried fruit, freeze-dried slices break easily and melt slightly in the mouth, making them easy to snack on or sprinkle over smoothie bowls.
#### Flavor
Freeze-dried dragon fruit tends to have a milder, more delicate taste compared to the fresh version. While the sweetness is less intense, it retains much of the fruit’s natural freshness and color, offering a clean, tropical flavor.
#### How to use freeze-dried dragon fruit
**Easy snack:** Light, crunchy, and great on the go.
**Smoothies & ice cream:** Add tropical flavor and color.
**Overnight oats & salads:** A vibrant, nutritious topping.
**Pink drink:** Blend with coconut milk for a refreshing twist.

#### Where to buy freeze-dried dragon fruit
If you’re looking for a naturally sweet, vibrant tropical snack, [**this crunchy dragon fruit snack**](https://amzn.to/4loBlCS) from Vietnam (one of the world’s top dragon fruit exporters) is a high-quality option worth trying.
### **Dehydrated dragon fruit (chewy)**
#### Method
Dehydrated dragon fruit is made by slowly drying fresh slices at low temperatures, typically between 50–60°C (122–140°F), over an extended period. This gentle air-drying process removes a portion of the fruit’s moisture without fully drying it out. Once the desired moisture level is reached, the fruit is cooled and packaged. The result is a naturally sweet snack with a soft, flexible texture, without the crispiness of freeze-dried fruit.

#### Texture
Dehydrated dragon fruit has a soft, slightly flexible texture, similar to dried mango or dried [passion fruit](https://vivavn.com/passion-fruit/). The pieces are often a bit sticky and may require some chewing.
#### Flavor
The slow drying process tends to concentrate the fruit’s natural sugars, resulting in a deeper, more mellow sweetness. As the fruit is exposed to gentle heat over time, its color may also darken.
#### How to use dehydrated dragon fruit
Dehydrated dragon fruit is a delicious and flexible option. You can enjoy it as a snack on its own, or blend it into your smoothies, yogurt, or cereals.
#### Where to buy
If you’re interested in trying chewy dehydrated dragon fruit, there’s a thoughtfully made option from Vietnam. You can shop **[this chewy dragon fruit here](https://amzn.to/3ImzFLj)**.

_In this article, we’re diving into the vibrant world of Vietnamese pomelos, known as “bưởi.” We’ll explore everything from their unique shape, flavor, and varieties to the best ways to enjoy this refreshing citrus fruit. You’ll learn about the different types of pomelos grown throughout Vietnam, their distinct flavors, and even how to tell them apart. Plus, we’ll share tips on how to peel a pomelo, along with its nutritional benefits, and dive into its cultural significance and uses in Vietnamese cuisine and traditional medicine._
## What is Vietnamese pomelo?
**Overview**
**Vietnamese name:** bưởi
**Shape and appearance:** round to slightly pear-shaped, with thick, pale green to yellow skin. The interior ranges from pale yellow to pink.
**Flavor profile:** juicy and refreshing, with a balanced sweet-tart flavor and a mild hint of bitterness.
**How to enjoy it:** eat fresh, add to salads, use in desserts, or juice it for a refreshing drink.
**Harvest season:** pomelo is harvested year-round, but the peak season runs from May to August
### Shape and color
Vietnamese pomelo comes in a round to slightly pear-shaped form, with a diameter ranging from 6 to 10 inches (15–25 cm) and weighing between 2 to 4 pounds (1–3 kg). The thick, green rind changes to greenish-yellow or yellow as the fruit ripens, and can even turn red, depending on the variety.
### Inside of a pomelo
**Pith:** Just beneath the rind, there’s a white, spongy layer called the pith. It’s bitter in taste and usually not eaten.
**Segments:** Inside the fruit, there are sections called segments. Each pomelo typically contains between 10 to 20 segments, depending on its size and variety.
**Membranes (Segment Walls):** Each segment is surrounded by a thin, slightly bitter membrane.
**Seeds:** Some segments may contain seeds, which vary in size and number depending on the variety of the pomelo. The seeds are usually removed before eating.
### Taste and flavor
Pomelo tastes juicy and refreshing, with a nice mix of sweet and sour and a little bit of bitterness. Its flavor is unique, with hints of lemon and orange. The smell is also very appealing, fresh, and citrusy, like a blend of different**[citrus fruits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrus)**.
### Vietnamese pomelo tree appearance
Pomelo trees can grow to a height of 16 to 33 feet (5-10 meters) and have branches with sharp thorns that can be up to 3 inches (7 cm) long. The leaves have distinct, wing-like petioles and an oval or elliptical shape, ranging from 2 to 8 inches long. The leaves are leathery with a dull green color on top and slightly hairy underneath. The flowers, which can grow alone or in clusters, are fragrant and have a yellow-white color.
**Pomelo origin**
Pomelo is a citrus fruit native to Southeast Asia and holds the title of the largest citrus fruit in the world! Interestingly, the pomelo is the main ancestor of the grapefruit. Grapefruits were created by crossbreeding sweet oranges and pomelos. Vietnam, with its ideal climate and soil, is the largest producer of pomelos globally. Thanks to these perfect growing conditions, pomelo trees thrive all over the country.
## Vietnamese pomelo varieties
Vietnam has many delicious varieties of pomelo, found throughout the North, Central, and Southern regions of the country. Below, we’ll highlight some of the best Vietnamese pomelo varieties and their unique characteristics. But before we dive in, it’s helpful to understand one important concept: the Brix level.
**Brix Level (°Bx)** measures the sugar content in a liquid as a percentage. One degree Brix equals 1 gram of sugar (specifically sucrose) in 100 grams of liquid. It’s a common way to gauge how sweet things like fruit, juice, wine, and honey are. The higher the Brix level, the sweeter the product.
### Da Xanh Pomelo
Originating from Ben Tre Province in the lush Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, **[the Da Xanh pomelo](https://vivavn.com/da-xanh-pomelo/)** is one of the most famous and sought-after citrus varieties in the country, even making its way to markets around the world.
This pomelo is known for its round shape, typically weighing between 1.2 to 2.5 kilograms (around 2.6 to 5.5 pounds). The fruit has a green to slightly yellow-green skin when ripe, which is easy to peel, being relatively thin (only about 14–18 mm). Inside, the segments are a beautiful pinkish-red color. The taste is sweet with a hint of tanginess, accompanied by a distinctive fragrance that makes it truly unique. With a Brix level ranging from 9.5% to 12%, the Da Xanh pomelo offers a delightful balance of natural sweetness and a little tartness.
### Nam Roi pomelo
The Nam Roi pomelo is known for its pear-like shape and moderate size, usually weighing between 1 to 2 kilograms (about 2 to 4 pounds). Its skin is thin and easy to peel, and as it ripens, it turns from greenish-yellow to a more vibrant yellow. Inside, you’ll find juicy segments with a pale yellow hue and a delightful aroma.
When it comes to flavor, the Nam Roi pomelo has a light, sweet taste with a subtle hint of tartness, yet without any of the bitterness you might find in some other citrus fruits. With a Brix level ranging from 9.67% to 10.82%.
### Dien Pomelo
While the South of Vietnam is known for the Da Xanh and Nam Roi pomelos, the North boasts its own beloved variety: the Dien pomelo. Named after the village of Dien in Hanoi, this pomelo is famous and cherished throughout the country.
The Dien pomelo is smaller in size compared to its southern counterparts, with a diameter of about 15 cm (around 6 inches) and a weight of roughly 0.8 to 1 kilogram (about 1.7 to 2.2 pounds). Its skin is thin and turns a golden yellow when ripe, encasing segments that are also yellow. The flavor is deeply sweet, and the fruit becomes even sweeter as the skin naturally dries out over time. This unique characteristic makes the Dien pomelo a true delight for those who enjoy a rich, concentrated citrus flavor.
### Luan Van Pomelo
The Luan Van pomelo comes from the village of the same name in Thanh Hoa Province, in central Vietnam. What makes this pomelo special is its bright red skin, which is about 15 cm (6 inches) in diameter, and its beautiful red segments inside.
It has a sweet flavor with a little bit of tartness, and a Brix level between 11.05% and 15.40%, meaning it’s naturally sweet. Because of its striking color and delicious taste, it was once offered to kings during festivals.
## Nutritional benefits of pomelo
Here’s the nutritional breakdown for a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of pomelo, based on data from the **[USDA](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/167754/nutrients)** :

## How to eat pomelo
Peeling a pomelo is easier than it looks, and here’s how you can do it in a few simple steps:
**Step 1:** Start by cutting off the top and bottom ends of the pomelo.
**Step 2:** Make vertical cuts around the fruit, slicing about half an inch (1.5 cm) deep into the thick skin. Cut the skin into 4 to 6 sections evenly.
**Step 3:** Use your fingers to gently pull the sections of the skin away from the fruit. Don’t worry if the pomelo looks much smaller once it’s peeled — that’s totally normal!
**Step 4:** Next, use your fingers to split the peeled pomelo in half.
**Step 5:** Now, you can easily separate the individual segments.
**Step 6:** For each segment, peel off the outer membrane, and enjoy the juicy, refreshing goodness inside!

_Did you know purple rice has been cherished for centuries in Asia for its striking color and health benefits? In this article, let’s explore how the Vietnamese grow purple rice, its nutritional value, and some delicious dishes made from it._
## Introduction
Purple rice, also known as black rice, forbidden rice, or emperor’s rice has been cultivated in Asia for thousands of years. Rich in nutrients and packed with health benefits, this grain is now gaining popularity among health-conscious consumers. As people increasingly seek out nutritious and wholesome foods, purple rice is becoming a top choice for its impressive health advantages.
## History and Origins
Purple rice, believed to have originated in China, was once reserved exclusively for emperors. It was thought to promote longevity and bring good fortune. Common people were forbidden from eating it, which is why it’s called ‘forbidden rice’ or ’emperor’s rice.’ Over time, this rice spread to other parts of Asia, including Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and [Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam). It gradually became popular and is now a staple in many cultures.
## Nutritional Benefits
### 1. Rich in Antioxidants
This rice has a deep purple or black color because its outer layer is rich in anthocyanins, powerful antioxidants with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. These antioxidants help reduce the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and obesity
### 2. Nutrient Profile
**Protein** : Purple rice is rich in protein, with 100 grams containing about 8.89 grams of protein. The protein in purple rice helps reduce muscle loss and strengthens bones.
**Fiber** : Purple rice is high in fiber, which promotes digestive health, aids in weight loss, lowers cholesterol and reduces blood pressure.
**Iron** : Purple rice is an excellent source of iron, an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in producing red blood cells and transporting oxygen throughout the body.
